Note that it\\'s the same as in R, but not as in the UCI\\nMachine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.\\n\\nThis is perhaps the best known database to be found in the\\npattern recognition literature.  Fisher\\'s paper is a classic in the field and\\nis referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The\\ndata set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a\\ntype of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the\\nlatter are NOT linearly separable from each other.\\n\\n.. dropdown:: References\\n\\n  - Fisher, R.A. \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\"\\n    Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936); also in \"Contributions to\\n    Mathematical Statistics\" (John Wiley, NY, 1950).\\n  - Duda, R.O., & Hart, P.E.

I\\'d prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can\\nlook up their minor league stats.

However, the next year, at\\nage 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,\\nand has been there ever since.  It\\'s really hard for me to see where he\\nwould have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was\\nperformed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \"rushed\";\\nCleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have\\nbeen less likely to give up on him.\\n\\nYes, if you bring a player up early, he\\'s likely going to struggle.

What, you may ask, does gas guns\\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\\n\\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\\n\\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\\nof atmospheres.\\n\\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\\nand about 50 cm long.\\n\\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \\n\\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\\nthe projectile vaporizes.\\n\\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\\nto follow the projectiles.\\n\\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\\n\\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\\n\\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\\nsized payloads into space.

One of them is the ERA statistic for\\n: pitchers. What does it say ??\\n\\nERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per\\nnine inning game.  Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned\\nrun, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERA\\nis 3.00.  To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided\\nby the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.\\n\\n\\tERA = (ER/IP) * 9\\n\\nAn earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed\\nto a fielding error.  More specifically, if an error occurs that represented\\nthe third out, all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs.\\nEarned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base\\nwhen the pitcher exited the game.  Here are some examples:\\n\\n\\tIf there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base.  If\\n\\tan error occurs that represents the third out, all of the runs after\\n\\tthis error and NOT counted as earned runs.\\n\\n\\tIf a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks), and leaves the game\\n\\tbefore the inning is completed, he is responsible for the people who\\n\\twere left on base.  If the those runners who were left on base score,\\n\\tand the score was not a result of an error, those eraned runs are\\n\\tattributed to the pitcher who left the game.\\n\\nI hope this explains things for you.\",\n",

Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former\\nGopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.\\n\\nThe Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow.  Starting\\nPitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks.  The Detroit\\nTigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide \\nquite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff.\\n\\nThe Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield,\\nthe third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.\\n\\nBrian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second\\nthis year, and shows much improvement in this category.\\n\\nJim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.  Some say he \\nhas the best 1st base move in baseball.  This move has enabled him to pitch\\nout of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 \\nstart.

He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn\\'t\\nwinning.\\n\\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\\nmistake being made (by the SDCN\\'s, as they are known, on this group)\\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\\n\\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\\n\\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\\na player with poor MLE\\'s (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don\\'t (Oddibe\\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn\\'t hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\\nand so on.\\n\\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\\n\\nWhat hasn\\'t been established is what happens when you encounter a player\\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t been established that you can use MLE\\'s with two-sport players.\\n(It hasn\\'t been established that you can\\'t, but then statistics is, after\\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don\\'t mean what they usually mean?\\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \\n\\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE\\'s.  But you guys DON\\'T KNOW.  What\\'s \\nworse, you don\\'t know that you don\\'t.  And you don\\'t know that there are \\nother players you won\\'t know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \\nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.

It is necessary to score more runs than\\none\\'s opponent to win the game, so it would seem important to score runs\\nand to prevent one\\'s opponent from scoring.  Runs are scored while a team\\nis batting, and an inning ends after the third out, so it would seem that\\nmaking outs is bad while hitting home runs is good.  Players have tendencies\\nto hit or pitch at certain levels, and these are usually somewhat consistent\\nfrom year to year.\\n\\nWe do use these statistics to predict winners, and so do you.  To make\\nsome flat predictions:  Barry Bonds will have a higher OBP+SLG than\\nGene Larkin this year.  The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockies\\nin the standings.  The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals, but\\nwill also give up more.  I would be astonished if any of these turned\\nout to be false, and, I suspect, so would you.

Ancient astronomers observed points of\\nlight that appeared to move among the stars. They called these\\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman\\ndeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;\\nMercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and\\nbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The\\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\\n\\n     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.\\nFundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were\\ncalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\\ndiscoveries.\\n\\n     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\\nsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World\\nWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\\'s gravity\\nand travel to the Moon and to other planets.\\n\\n     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then\\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated\\nmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the\\nSun\\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\\nwhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\\n\\n     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\\nunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight\\nand other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and\\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\\nto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\\nAnd dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\\n\\n     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\\nachievements of the 20th century.\\n     \\n\\nAUTOMATED SPACECRAFT\\n\\n     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\'s (NASA\\'s)\\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\\nshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and\\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\\n\\n     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\\nas for processing data and communicating with Earth.\\n\\n     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\\ninstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays\\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\\nsolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for\\nbackup and supplemental power.\\n\\n     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help\\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\\ncontrol spacecraft.\\n\\n     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\\nconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\\'s early seafarers\\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\\nmaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto\\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\\nspacecraft\\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body\\nand the craft\\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The\\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\\n\\n     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to\\nstudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\\ninner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These\\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\\n\\n     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA\\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\\nMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later\\nmissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted\\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\\n\\n     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power\\nsource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were\\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\\nbodies.\\n\\n     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus\\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\\nMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\\nprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had\\noriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The\\nMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components\\nleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.\\n\\n     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.\\nInterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,\\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\\n\\n     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers\\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\\nsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took\\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\\nBarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun\\'s\\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\\n\\n     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\\nour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin\\nViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\\nstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --\\ndescendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers\\nfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.\\n\\n     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.\\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\\nthat allowed it to \"see\" through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover\\nto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried\\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and\\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\\nradioed information about the planet\\'s atmosphere during their\\ndescent toward the surface.\\n\\n     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\\nMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet\\nRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being\\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\\nneighborhood and our own planet.\\n     \\n\\nThe Sun\\n\\n     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\\nwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\\nto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the\\nmaterial left over from the Sun\\'s formation. One hundred and nine\\nEarths would be required to fit across the Sun\\'s disk, and its\\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.\\n\\n     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of\\nfusion. The temperature at the Sun\\'s core is 15 million degrees\\nCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there\\nis 340 billion times Earth\\'s air pressure at sea level. The Sun\\'s\\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees\\nFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\\nAt the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\\nenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\\n\\n     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\\nso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium\\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\\nso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a\\n\"red giant,\" it will suddenly collapse into a \"white dwarf\" --\\nthe final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion\\nyears to cool off completely.\\n\\n     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun\\'s environment, but\\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\\ntwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,\\nthe Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\\nhave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,\\nlaunched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and\\nthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\\'s gravity to\\nchange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun\\'s polar\\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\\n\\n     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If\\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\\nnever have developed on Earth.\\n     \\n\\nMercury\\n\\n     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the\\nprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\\nNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a\\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,\\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\\nsolar system\\'s innermost planet on March 29, 1974.\\n\\n     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the\\nbest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct\\nobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the\\nSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is\\nvisible on Earth\\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar\\ntelescopes gave any hint of Mercury\\'s surface conditions prior to\\nthe voyage of Mariner 10.\\n\\n     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an\\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\\nMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\\nplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury\\'s interior\\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet\\'s crust. The cliffs are as\\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\\nmiles).\\n\\n     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak\\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\\ndensity of Earth\\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\\nand helium. When the planet\\'s orbit takes it closest to the Sun,\\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees\\nFahrenheit) on Mercury\\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius\\n(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface\\ntemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --\\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury\\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\\n\\n     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a\\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid\\nrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury\\nsolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time\\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\\nSun! \\n\\n     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\\nthat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich\\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would\\nmake Mercury\\'s core larger, proportionally, than the Moon\\'s core\\nor those of any of the planets.\\n\\n     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two\\nadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --\\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\\nand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same\\nlocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\\nplanet\\'s surface.\\n     \\n\\nVenus\\n\\n     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary\\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2\\nspacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more\\nthan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the\\nmysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,\\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus\\' surface,\\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\\nrest.\\n\\n     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839\\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first\\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\\nVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much\\ncloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\\nmiles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5\\'s\\ninstruments measured the planet\\'s magnetic field, ionosphere,\\nradiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner\\n10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth\\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.\\n\\n     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4\\nof the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first\\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\\n\\n     Five days later, the five separate components making up the\\nsecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the\\nVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The\\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\\natmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the\\nsurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\\ntransmit data for another hour.\\n\\n     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and\\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. However,\\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For\\nexample, Venus\\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other\\nplanets.\\n\\n     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus\\' atmosphere (95 times as\\ndense as Earth\\'s) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of\\nEarth\\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus\\' atmosphere acts like a\\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\\nspace. As a result, the planet\\'s average surface temperature is\\n482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\\nlead.\\n\\n     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the\\nfirst means of seeing through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover and\\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\\nNASA\\'s Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in\\norbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses\\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\\nof the surface.\\n\\n     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface\\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\\nlying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar\\nTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At\\none end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size\\nof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain\\'s flank is a\\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\\nimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are\\nnamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are\\nthe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million\\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\\n\\n     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\\non Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\\nthe San Andreas Fault in California.\\n\\n     Venus\\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At\\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The\\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus\\'\\nslow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth\\'s winds blow in\\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\\nalternating bands. Venus\\' atmosphere serves as a simplified\\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\\n     \\n\\nEarth\\n\\n     As viewed from space, our world\\'s distinguishing\\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\\nand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\\nconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor\\nlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million\\nkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the\\nSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.\\n\\n     Our planet\\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\\ncoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth\\'s atmosphere protects\\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\\nstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left no\\nevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon\\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the\\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\\nthe early days of the solar system.\\n\\n     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\\nhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was\\nlaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and\\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen\\nradiation belts, surrounding Earth.\\n\\n     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\\nplanet\\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\\nejected from the Sun. We\\'ve learned that the magnetic field does\\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now\\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\\ncontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the\\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.\\n\\n     Besides affecting Earth\\'s weather, solar activity gives rise\\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged\\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\\'s magnetic\\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet\\'s\\nmagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are\\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\\n\\n     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These\\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous\\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\\ncontributes to a better understanding of Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems.\\n\\n     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\\nEarth\\'s oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet\\'s\\nhealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\\nplanet in dangerous ways.\\n     \\n\\nThe Moon\\n\\n     The Moon is Earth\\'s single natural satellite. The first\\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by American\\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\\ncompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo\\nexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and\\nLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.\\n\\n     NASA\\'s Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\\nand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\\n\\n     From this material and other studies, scientists have\\nconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.\\nRocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\\nbillion years old. The first few million years of the Moon\\'s\\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\\nAs a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\\ndifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\\nand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode\\nIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created\\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\\n\\n     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\\nrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\\nmelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\\n(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million\\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\\nfrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the\\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\\nthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,\\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\\n\\n     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant\\nvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.\\nSince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,\\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\\nastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion\\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\\none today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\\nApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\\n\\n     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories\\nattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate\\nbody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was\\ncaptured by our planet\\'s gravity, or it was the result of a\\ncollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.\\nThe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\\n     \\n\\nMars\\n\\n     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar\\nsystem\\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\\nAstronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These\\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson\\nWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\\nclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed\\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\\n\\n     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to\\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\\'s\\nsurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\\n\\n     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.\\nFour Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\\nbefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.\\n\\n     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,\\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\\nsurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the\\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\\nMariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\\n\\n     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a\\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The\\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\\nfind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the\\nstorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\\n\\n     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\\nKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several\\nquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?\\nNobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\\nhoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at\\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\\n\\n     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,\\nwhile the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos\\nsent back from the Chryse Planitia (\"Plains of Gold\") showed a\\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the\\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\\nby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives\\nthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia\\nPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\\ndunes.\\n\\n     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking\\nLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil\\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\\nbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed to\\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\\'s soil\\nchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the\\nViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\\nthere.\\n\\n     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind\\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\\npressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest\\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.\\n\\n     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees\\nFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2\\nsite during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking\\nLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\\n\\n     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily\\ncarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\\npercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning\\nfog can form in valleys.\\n\\n     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian\\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical\\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\\n\\n     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and\\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is\\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\\nclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.\\n\\n     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins\\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The\\nfirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\\nJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\\nViking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut\\ndown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on\\nAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\\nused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.\\n\\n     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology\\nexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except\\nEarth. NASA\\'s Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in\\nSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \\n     \\n\\nAsteroids\\n\\n     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\\nobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be\\nconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as\\nasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a\\nband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have\\norbits that cross Earth\\'s path, and there is evidence that Earth\\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,\\nbest preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near\\nWinslow, Arizona.\\n\\n     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\\nsolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a\\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More\\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\\nplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\\ndiameter of our Moon. \\n\\n     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It\\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\\nphotographed through Earth-based telescopes.\\n\\n     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\\nEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are\\ncalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the\\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what\\'s left strikes\\nEarth\\'s surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places\\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.\\n\\n     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony\\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\\nlike terrestrial rocks.\\n\\n     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar\\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\\nSpacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\\nseparated by very large distances.\\n\\n     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\\nfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in\\nOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\\nJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini\\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for\\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini\\nmissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space\\nAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as\\nwell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.\\nOne day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\\nmaterials.\\n     \\n\\nJupiter\\n\\n     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,\\nUranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four\\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter\\nwas the first port of call.\\n\\n     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in\\nMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In\\nDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,\\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet\\'s\\nbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1\\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\\nspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites\\nduring flybys in 1979.\\n\\n     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of\\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice\\ncrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps\\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\\ncharacterize Jupiter\\'s atmosphere.\\n\\n     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\\nplanet\\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\\nbelow. Because of Jupiter\\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these\\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\\n\\n     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through\\ntelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter\\'s\\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a\\nhigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction\\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is\\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\\nare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a\\nmillion years old.\\n\\n     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter\\'s upper\\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth\\'s\\nnorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned\\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.\\n\\n     Largest of the solar system\\'s planets, Jupiter rotates at a\\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The\\nmassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey\\naround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a\\nminiature solar system.\\n\\n     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under\\nway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once\\npast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two\\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\\nJupiter\\'s cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo\\nOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\\nto Jupiter\\'s large moons, exploring in detail what the two\\nPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.\\n     \\n\\nGalilean Satellites\\n\\n     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and\\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first\\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of\\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\\nGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily\\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\\nreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\\nplanet-sized satellites.\\n\\n     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission\\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.\\nVolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\\nother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine\\nactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending\\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\\'s surface.\\n\\n     Io\\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\\nthe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this\\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\\ngravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three\\nGalilean moons.\\n\\n     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the\\nbrightest Galilean satellite. The moon\\'s surface displays a\\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\\nfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa\\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered\\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\\ncold of space. Europa\\'s core is made of rock that sank to its\\ncenter.\\n\\n     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and\\nCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest\\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury\\nand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\\nice and the rest rock. Ganymede\\'s surface has areas of different\\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\\nthe moon\\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the\\nsurface.\\n\\n     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the\\nlowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large\\namounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the\\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\\n\\n     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be\\nperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.\\n     \\n\\nSaturn\\n\\n     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its\\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is\\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors\\nand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn\\'s atmosphere\\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\\nby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\\'s somewhat placid-looking\\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\\nmiles) per hour.\\n\\n     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11\\nsped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,\\nreturning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in\\nNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn\\'s ring\\nsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\\nAugust 1981.\\n\\n     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles\\norbiting individually around Saturn\\'s equator at progressive\\ndistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves\\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are\\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\\n\\n     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\\nventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been\\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\\ninterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn\\'s gravity. A\\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\\n\\n     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\\nthe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These\\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\\nthat make up the major rings.\\n\\n     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM\\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager\\nspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are\\nbelieved to be coming from Saturn\\'s ring system rather than its\\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at\\nJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth\\'s auroras near\\nSaturn\\'s poles.\\n\\n     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several\\nsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons\\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn\\'s rings and the gaps\\nin the rings. Saturn\\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\\nimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. \\n\\n     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based\\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth\\'s in\\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and\\nVenus. Titan\\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\\nUnfortunately, Voyager\\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\\'s\\ndense clouds.\\n\\n     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\\nconverting Titan\\'s methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter\\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may\\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth\\nbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan\\'s\\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\\n\\n     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini\\nmission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\\nalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into\\nTitan\\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the\\nprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan\\'s clouds and will\\nspend years examining the Saturnian system.\\n     \\n\\nUranus\\n\\n     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting\\nSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\\nUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about\\nUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\\nground observations since the planet\\'s discovery over two\\ncenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.\\n\\n     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\\nsolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of\\nPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\\naround the solar system. During Voyager 2\\'s flyby, the south pole\\nfaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an\\nEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\\nsolar system.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 found that Uranus\\' magnetic field does not follow\\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,\\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\\'s\\ncenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one\\nmagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of\\nDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.\\n\\n     Uranus\\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\\nvapor. The planet\\'s blue color occurs because methane in its\\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580\\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\\ntops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).\\n\\n     Uranus\\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\\nphotochemical \"smog\" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the\\nplanet\\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as \"electroglow.\"\\n\\n     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus\\'\\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\\nBeneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --\\nMiranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from\\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing\\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\\n\\n     The most remarkable of Uranus\\' moons is Miranda. Its surface\\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\\nwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\\nfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda\\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\\nits interior exposed on its surface.\\n\\n     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged\\n11. In contrast to Saturn\\'s rings, which are composed of bright\\nparticles, Uranus\\' rings are primarily made up of dark,\\nboulder-sized chunks.\\n     \\n\\nNeptune\\n\\n     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\\nwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet\\'s moons. On\\nAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\\n(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.\\nDuring the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\\'s\\natmosphere was more active than Uranus\\'. \\n\\n     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the\\nsize of Earth, in Neptune\\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\\'s\\nGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager\\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\\nthe \"Scooter,\" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any\\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\\nhour.\\n\\n     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet\\'s core\\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\\nother gas giants. Neptune\\'s distinctive blue appearance, like\\nUranus\\' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\\n\\n     Neptune\\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\\'s\\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is\\nsimilar to Uranus\\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\\nelectrical properties of a metal. Earth\\'s magnetic field, on the\\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune\\'s rings.\\nObservations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of\\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how\\nNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected\\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\\nA number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\\nwere not spotted.\\n\\n     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in\\n1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new\\nmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since\\nProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet\\'s\\nglare for observers on Earth.\\n\\n      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\\ndays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly\\ntowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian\\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\\naccompany the planet\\'s modest current rings.\\n\\n     Triton\\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\\nIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at\\nSaturn and Uranus. Triton\\'s mantle is probably composed of\\nwater-ice, but the moon\\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\\nmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of\\nterrain: the so-called \"cantaloupe\" terrain and a receding ice\\ncap. \\n\\n     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the\\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\\n(1 to 5 miles). Triton\\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\\nthick as Earth\\'s, has winds that carry the dark particles and\\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees\\nFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other\\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\\n     \\n\\nPluto\\n\\n     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\\nNeptune\\'s orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\\nremain until March 1999. Pluto\\'s orbit is also highly inclined --\\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\\n\\n     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a\\ncelestial snowball. The planet\\'s diameter is calculated to be\\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\\nsize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\\'s\\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\\nmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\\'s spin\\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \\n\\n     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in\\n1978. Charon\\'s surface composition is different from Pluto\\'s: the\\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\\nice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both\\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\\'s\\nand Charon\\'s rotational period and Charon\\'s period of revolution\\nare all 6.4 Earth days. \\n\\n     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is\\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\\n     \\n\\nComets\\n\\n     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\\nvisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and\\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\\nfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a\\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\\n\\n     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\\nto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself\\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\\n\\n     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\\nor cloud-like \"head\" that can measure tens of thousands of\\nkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\\nSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes\\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\\nrise to the comet\\'s \"tails.\" Gases and ions are blown directly\\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\\nAs the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\\nleft behind in a curved arc.\\n\\n     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in\\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.\\nThe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --\\nfrom the Latin cometa, meaning \"long-haired\" -- are essentially\\ndramatic light shows.\\n\\n     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter\\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\\nto the inner solar system.\\n\\n     Halley\\'s Comet is the most famous example of a relatively\\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\\nyears and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus\\' orbit.\\nConfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular\\nvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,\\nbecause he plotted the comet\\'s orbit and predicted its return,\\nbased on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name\\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\\nreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to\\nsee it.\\n\\n     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\\ncomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent\\nappearance, Halley\\'s Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was\\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so\\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\\nHistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\\n\\n     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will\\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF\\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\\nform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at\\nhigh speed; the first was NASA\\'s International Cometary Explorer\\nin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet\\nand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by\\nHalley\\'s Comet in 1986.\\n     \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\\nonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,\\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\\nneighbors in space. \\n\\n     We have learned more about our solar system and its members\\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated\\nspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets\\nbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large\\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\\nenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\\ngenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\\nand beautiful places and objects.\\n\\n     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\\nsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and\\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\\ncomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,\\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\\n\\n     We are also gaining insight into Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\\ninvestigating the Sun\\'s activity and its influence throughout the\\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\\nprocesses on Earth.\\n\\n     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission\\nis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\\nthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future\\nmissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid\\nbelt.\\n\\n     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once\\nagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not\\nbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being\\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\\nhuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian\\noutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\\nlunar base or a martian colony!',\n",

Unlike the conventional large \\nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \\nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \\nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \\nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \\nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \\ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \\nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \\nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \\nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \\nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \\ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \\nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \\nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \\nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \\nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \\nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C).

I would\\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\\npositive association between John\\'s statistic and winning games.  Thus,\\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\\n\\n\\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\\nThus, I\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\\nthe pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\\nwould win.\\n \\nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down.  I\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\\n\\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were\\nperformed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43\\n(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results \\nindicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground\\nstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.\\n\\n2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the\\nMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the\\nspacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS\\n(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to\\npreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a\\nsource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).\\n\\n4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was\\nperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of\\ntwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the\\nspacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.\\n\\n6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.\\nThe RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately\\n20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18\\ndegrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back\\nto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the\\nantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The\\nRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had\\nincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.\\n\\n     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was\\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,\\na Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on\\nMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the\\nTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test\\nmini-sequence.\\n\\n7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under\\nstored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees\\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of\\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was\\nat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\\ndegrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time\\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN\\n(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 203 hours\\n\\n\\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\\n\\n1.

The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\\n \\nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\\nthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw\\nto third and EASILY got the runner at third.\\n \\nMy heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.\\n \\nAstacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game\\nwith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.\\n \\nGross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3\\ninnings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning\\ngame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh\\ngiven his light work out Tuesday.\\n \\nGross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit\\nto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted\\nin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it\\n3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next\\nthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on\\nfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had\\nscored long before that.\\n \\nMeanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.\\nLee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros\\nand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).\\nCory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but\\nthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his\\nthird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my\\nfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.

For\\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\\n\\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\\nfrom past masters.\\n\\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \\nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\\'ve made us mad!  What are these\\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\\n\\n     Well I\\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\\nless than many billions of dollars.\\n\\n     It took some of the last generation\\'s experts to teach us\\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\\'s first rocket was not a\\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\\'s ICBM\\'s didn\\'t take ten years to\\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\\'t cost $1 billion.\\n\\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\\'s to remind\\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\\'s. \\nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\\nlittle, Test a little.\\n\\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\\ndidn\\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\\'d just change\\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn\\'t spend a\\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\\'s the\\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\\'t\\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\\nthreat that he\\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\\nit ran over cost or schedule.\\n\\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\\'t keep in mind its\\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\\nbudget.\\n\\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\\n(See charts)\\n\\n     I\\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\\'s\\nand 1960\\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\\ncan\\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\\n\\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\\n\\n     I say to you -- we\\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\\nbring your view-graphs, and I\\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Double\\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\\narticle.\\n\\nThe short version -- definition of terms\\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player\\'s total contribution.\\n\\nNational League\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865\\nSandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015\\nThompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852\\nLind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571\\nDoran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705\\nDeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755\\nHarris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602\\nLemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573\\nMorandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580\\nRandolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582\\nBiggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656\\nStillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336\\n\\nOrdered by DOPS\\n\\n1.015 Sandberg\\n .865 Alicea\\n .852 Thompson\\n .755 DeShields\\n .705 Doran\\n .678 *NL Average*\\n .656 Biggio\\n .602 Harris\\n .582 Randolph\\n .580 Morandini\\n .573 Lemke\\n .571 Lind\\n .336 Stillwell\\n\\nAmerican League\\n---------------\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811\\nReed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708\\nRipken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631\\nBaerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838\\nBlankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757\\nMiller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725\\nAlomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812\\nKnoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718\\nBordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704\\nKelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636\\nWhitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806\\nReynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603\\nSax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555\\nSojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602\\n\\nOrder by DOPS\\n\\n.838 Baerga\\n.812 Alomar\\n.811 Fletcher\\n.806 Whitaker\\n.757 Blankenship\\n.725 Miller\\n.718 Knoblauch\\n.708 Reed\\n.704 Bordick\\n.691 *AL Average*\\n.636 Kelly\\n.631 Ripken\\n.603 Reynolds\\n.602 Sojo\\n.555 Sax\\n\\nMore discussion --\\n\\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

In addition, many stand alone\\nunderwater training \"runs\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\\n\\n\\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\\n\\n\\tEndeavour\\'s June flight and Discovery\\'s July mission both will include\\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\\nHuntsville, Ala.\\n\\n\\tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\\ntrainers.\\n\\n\\tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\\n\\n\\tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.

              "  'I\\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\\'ve \\ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\n\\nMichael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an\\ninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.\\nACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and\\nInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\\n\\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \\nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\\nsatellite slots.  While this isn\\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\\nslots.\\n\\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\\nsupporting Tonga\\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \\n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \\nthe Pacific Rim. \\n\\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It\\'s not easy to raise that kind of money.\\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \\nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \\nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don\\'t think I\\'ll visit there for a long time.\\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\\nthat people operate.  For example \"everybody can sell you everything.\"  \\nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\\n\\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \\nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \\nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \\nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\\n\\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \\nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \\nSiberia (can\\'t figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\\n\\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \\napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \\nspecifications, they\\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \\nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \\nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\\nnow.\\n\\nTidbits:\\n\\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\\nthat \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"\\n\\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\\nwithin 9 months.\\n\\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\\n\\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\\npartly because we aren\\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government \"every two weeks\" but we don\\'t worry \\nbecause we\\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\\nreally goes on in Russia we won\\'t worry about their stability as much.\\n\\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in \\nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\\n\\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \\nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\\n\\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \\nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \\ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\\nhardware.\\n',\n",

It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked \\nat players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they\\nwere 24, and noticed some interesting things. \\n\\n  For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in\\nthe history of the game. They also found out such players represented the\\nmajority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that\\nthey actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers\\nlasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also  \\nfound that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and\\nproduced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first\\ngroup outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away\\nthe second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc. \\n\\n  It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory. \\n\\n  I guess Ray Knight makes his rebuttal tonight. \\n \",\n",

              "  'Disclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the centerfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Juan\\nGonzalez would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Juan\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin\\'s 55.4% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Extra \\nBases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.

For me, going\\nto an A's game has become a major commitment of time, one that I'm not\\nwilling to make that often:  the length of their games is costing the A's\\nrevenue from me.\",\n",

But they have been systematically \\n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \\n\\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \\n          space and time: \\n    \\n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \\n    \\n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \\n    \\n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \\n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \\n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \\n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \\n          DATUM\"). \\n      \\n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \\n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \\n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \\n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \\n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \\n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \\n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \\n          BURSTS). \\n          \\n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \\n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \\n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \\n          matter. \\n\\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \\n          complex mathematics, in his books. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \\n          organization that was started to promote Larson\\'s Theory.  \\n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \\n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \\n\\n          \\n\\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s Background\\n    \\n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \\n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \\n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \\n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \\n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \\n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \\n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \\n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \\n     \\n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \\n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \\n          researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in \\n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \\n    \\n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \\n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \\n    \\n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \\n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of \\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \\n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \\n    \\n    \\n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \\n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or \\n          still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE \\n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \\n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \\n          Minneapolis after retiring. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\\n          \\n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \\n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \\n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \\n          value. \\n    \\n               Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the \\n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \\n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \\n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \\n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \\n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \\n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \\n          with their environment. \\n    \\n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \\n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \\n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \\n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \\n    \\n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \\n          BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for \\n          this WASTED money?! \\n    \\n     \\n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \\n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \\n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \\n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \\n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \\n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \\n    \\n          \\n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \\n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \\n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \\n      \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\\n          \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \\n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\n          other. \\n      \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \\n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \\n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \\n          MATERIAL half. \\n       \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\\n          \\n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \\n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \\n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\n          help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\". \\n    \\n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \\n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \\n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \\n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \\n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \\n    \\n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \\n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \\n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \\n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \\n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \\n          about this.] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \\n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \\n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory, \\n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \\n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \\n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \\n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \\n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \\n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \\n          FANTASY). \\n    \\n                                    \\n          \\n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\n\\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \\n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \\n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\n    \\n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \\n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \\n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \\n    \\n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \\n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\n    \\n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\n          OPEN MINDS! \\n    \\n               The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success: \\n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \\n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \\n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \\n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s \\n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\n    \\n\\n \\n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\\n\\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \\n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\n          directions uniformly.) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \\n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \\n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of his other books. \\n    \\n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal \\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter elements. \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \\n          of his books [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \\n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbiting each other. \\n     \\n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \\n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          his own version of Bode\\'s Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \\n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\n    \\n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \\n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \\n          holes\", etc.! \\n    \\n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about \\n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \\n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\n    \\n    \\n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \\n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.

It does NOT! \\n    \\n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \\n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s \\n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \\n          Unified Science). \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\\n\\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\n          with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\n    \\n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \\n          Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \\n    \\n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \\n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT \\n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\n          \\n               Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \\n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\n          according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\n    \\n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\n          light! \\n    \\n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge \\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\n          rotation of the particle.) \\n      \\n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\n          generated in clouds. \\n\\n\\n\\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\\n\\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B.

              "  'I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations\\nrule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is\\nutterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to\\nBATSE press releases.\\nThe idea behind the statement is as follows: \\n     \"if you smack two neutron\\n      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,\\n      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a\\n      cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy \\n      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes\\n      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.\\n      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must\\n      be wrong.\"\\nAs so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who\\nwas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It\\nmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray\\nburst, but the \\'fireball\\' of energy and matter that is created\\nmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding \\nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All\\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,\\nPeter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\\nIt is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative\\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \\nso-called \\'failed supernovae\\' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which\\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\\nhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\\nblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such\\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\\nof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two\\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\\nin the failed supernova scenario.\\n\\nOn another note: I do believe that the distance scale must \\nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists\\nhave historically not been too successfull in finding the\\ndistance of any object by proving that there is only one\\npossible way in which the object can work, and therefore\\nit *must* be so-and-so.',\n",

Remember from stellar evolution that \\nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\\nM(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,\\nthey don\\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB\\'s) will be in the plane of the\\ngalaxy.  \\n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\\nsuppose you are saying, \"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\\ndisk.\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here\\'s an \\nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \\n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don\\'t work, also.  As I\\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \\nin the direction of the  galactic center.

Gain values\\n\\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\\n\\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \"high-thrust\"\\n\\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\\n\\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\\n\\t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\\n\\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\\n\\t    \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a\\n\\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\\n\\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\\n\\tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\\n\\n\\t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\\n\\t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\\n\\t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\\n\\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\\n\\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\\n\\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\\n\\t    other special applications would be at hand.

Peak burn densities of tens\\n\\t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the\\n\\t    multi-gigawatt electric output size.

To summarize:\\n  \\nSPACE ADVERTISING\\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\\'s logos on the\\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\\n   This has not been considered \"paid advertising\" but rather\\n\"public relations\", since the restrictions have been such that only\\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\\na 10\\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\\nis \"advertising\" as much as it is \"public relations\", in my\\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\\'s which looked at\\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\\nbay.  These ventures would be different than \"public relations\", in\\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\\nwould scan past it.)\\n  \\nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\\'s upcoming movie \"The Last\\nAction Hero\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\\nmain fuselage of the mission\\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \"would not use\\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\\nreceiving compensation.\"   This is being disputed, since the launch\\nis a \"commercial launch\" and NASA is receiving none of the\\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\\ncoming from NASA.)\\n  \\nORBITAL \"BILLBOARDS\"\\n   Orbital \"billboards\" have been the staple of science fiction for\\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\\nHeinlein described another in \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\".

But these were\\nmiracles of our parent\\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\\nhave told us - \"you\\'ve lost it!\"  The \"me\" generation is only\\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\\n\\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\\'s work - and yes struggle\\n- to build this nation\\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\\n\\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\\nSchriever\\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\\n\\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \\nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\\'ve listened\\nto your stories.  We\\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \\nAnd we\\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\\ninto today\\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\\n\\n     You told us in the 60\\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\\naviation in the 1920\\'s and 30\\'s - build a little and test a little\\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\\nstarted this program for the SDI.\\n\\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\\'t even\\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\\'t take a decade or more\\nbefore putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you\\ndidn\\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\\'re not going to\\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\\naerospace transportation is real.\\n\\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\\nrelationship.\\n\\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\\n\\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\\nyes - we\\'ll make a little money off it too!\\n\\n     Then - and only then - we\\'ll spend another three years to\\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \\nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\\'s next step to the stars!\\n\\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\\'s first rockets weren\\'t Saturn\\nV\\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.

              "  '\\nInterstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The \"large\"\\ngrains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with\\nfair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the\\nthermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating\\nefficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long\\nwavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate\\nthe energy they have absorbed.\\n\\nMoreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100\\nmicrons.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer\\nwavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In\\nthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable\\nby any conceivable observation.\\n\\nWorse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a\\npopulation of \"small\" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50\\natoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to\\ntemperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool\\nquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_\\nthe characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small\\npopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed\\n\"average\" temperature.\\n\\nA model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has\\nthree components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal\\ndust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust\\n(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At\\nthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are\\nrespectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly\\ndoubled in the ecliptic plane.\\n\\nTo find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution\\nfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then\\ntake the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from\\nAllen\\'s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent\\nto 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work\\ncould do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a\\ndilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be\\ncooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density of\\nstarlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave\\nbackground, and I believe that to be correct.)\\n\\n                         Dilution   Temp.

              "  '\\nMy apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but \\ngot a message that my post might not have gone out.  Considering \\nthe confusing spitting contest over \\'rights\\', (there are TOO \\ninalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive \\nof liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out \\nof my site.    (I ain\\'t saying that dark skies are included in these \\nrights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAnyway, here are my thoughts on this: \\n\\n\\nI\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \\npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \\nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \\nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \\nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\nin an afterlife.  \\n\\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \\nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it \\nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \\nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \\neven if it can\\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \\n\\nRegards, \\nWm. Hathaway \\nBaltimore MD \\n',\n",

He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\\n\\n\\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\\n\\n\\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\\nmaking a case for him. \\n\\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\\nbring up his name.\\n\\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\\nprobably will turn into a definately.\\n\\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\\nthe possible votes.\\n\\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\\n\\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan\\nMaybe - Murray and L. Smith\\nNo - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman\\n\\nAs I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this\\nup - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.\",\n",

The US Industrial Outlook also \\nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \\nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \\n$450 M, future sales will be \"adversely affected by the downward \\nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans.\"                           \\n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \\nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \\nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \\nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \\nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \\n\\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \\nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \\nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \\nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \\n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \\nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \\nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \\nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \\nbusiness. \\n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \\nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \\nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \\nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \\npublishes a listing of  \"Space Business Indicators\" in mid-year, and \\nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \\nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \\nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \\nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \\n   Looking beyond this year\\'s data, future markets look quite \\npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \\n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \\nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \\nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \\nthrough the mid 1990\\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \\nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \\nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \\nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \\nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \\nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\\'t believe all of the \\ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \\nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \\nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \\nas currently projected.) \\n   It should also be noted this year\\'s DoC data is the first \\nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \\nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \\nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \\nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \\nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \\n\\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \\nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \\nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \\nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \\ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \\nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \\n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \\nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \\nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \\nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \\nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \\nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \\nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \\nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \\ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \\nnegotiation, and not yet final. \\n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \\ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \\nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \\nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \\nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\\'s Global \\nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \\nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \\nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \\nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \\nUnder this contract the USAF can also request \"launch on demand\" \\nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \\noccur within 40 days of the request. \\n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \\nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\\'s Delta launch program \\nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \\na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \\nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \\nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \\nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \\nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \\n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \\ncontracts.  Motorola\\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \\nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \\noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \\nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \\napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \\nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \\n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \\nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \\nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \\nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/\"Spacelifter\" program.  At this \\ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \\nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \\nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \\nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \\nCongress propose cancellation of all \"ELV upgrade\" programs \\n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \"Spacelifter\" \\nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\\'s budget \\ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \\nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \\n \\n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \"GO-AHEAD\"\\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \\nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \\nCommerce\\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \\nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \\noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \\nimages of the Earth. \\n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \\nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \\noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \\nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \\nventure as a \"Star Wars\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \\nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \\ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \\ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \\nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \\n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \\n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \\nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \\nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \\nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \\nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \\nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \\n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \\nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \\nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \\nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \\ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \\ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \\nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \\ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \\nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \\nappearing in the next year or so.] \\n                 \\n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\\'S SPACE BIZ \"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\" \\n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \\nDynamic\\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \\ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \\nanalyst\\'s report Morgan Stanley said \"We are more than ever \\nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \\n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\\ngenerating unit.\"  Based upon discussions with GD\\'s corporate \\nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \\ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \\n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\\'s projection of \\ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \\n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \\nhurt General Dynamic\\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \\nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \\nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\\'s space business might \\nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\\'s Space \\nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \\nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \\nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \\nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \\nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \\nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \\nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \\nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \\nsubstantial losses. \\n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \\nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \\nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \\nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \\nIn GD SSD\\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \\nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \\nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \\nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \\noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \\ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \\nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \\nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \\nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \\nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \\nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \\n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \\nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \\n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \\nchange for any company.] \\n \\n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \\nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\\'s.  In early \\nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \\ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \\nnext decade. \\n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \\nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \\ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \\nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \\ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\\'s Long \\nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \\n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \\ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \\nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \\nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \\ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \\n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \\nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \\ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \\nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \\nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \\nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\\'s average level, to \\nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \\n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \\nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \\ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \\nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \\ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \\nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \\nor near-term transponders. \\n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \\nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \\nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \\ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \\noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \\nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \\nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \\n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \\nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \\nComparing the two surveys, there aren\\'t outstanding differences in \\nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \\ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \\ntransponders on orbit.\\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \\nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \\nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \\ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \\ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \\nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \\nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \\nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \\ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \\nmillions or billions of dollars.  \\n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \\nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \\nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \\ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \\nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \\nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \\nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \\ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \\nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \\nhandle the increase in traffic. \\n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \\ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \\nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \\ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \\non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \\nlast generation\\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \\ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \\nlaunches over longer intervals. \\n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\\'t flag it this year, but it \\nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \\ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \\nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \\nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \\nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \\nJapan\\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \\nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \\nyear.  That\\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \\n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \\nlaunches.]\\n\\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \\n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \\nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \\nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \\nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \\nof range safety rules.  \\n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \\ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \\ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \\nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \\nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \\noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \\ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \\nvalid abort call. \\n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \\ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \\ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \\nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \\n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \\nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \\ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \\nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \\ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \\nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \\nin the launch. \\n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \\ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \\nby the Department of Commerce\\'s Office of Commercial Space \\nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \\n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \\ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \\nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \\ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \\nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \\ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \\nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \\nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \\nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \\nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \\nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \\nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \\nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \\ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \\nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \\nlaunch.  \\n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \\nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \\nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \\nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \\ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \\n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \\nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \\nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \\nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \\n\\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \\nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \\nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \"Aerokosmos\" \\nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \"Severkosmos\", \\nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \\nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \\nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \\nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \\nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \\n\\'Sineva\\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \\nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \\nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \\nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \\nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \\n   [Commentary: There\\'s very little released information on this new \\nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \\nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \\nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \\ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \\n   This one\\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \\nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\\'t identify any key customers being \\ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\\n\\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \\nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \\nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \\nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \\nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \\nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \\nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \\nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \\nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \\n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \\nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \\nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \\nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \\nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \\nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \\n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \\nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \\nsufficient to recover setup costs?\\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \\ninvestment?  \\n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \\nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \\nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \\nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \\non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\\n\\n9- SPAIN\\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \\nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \\nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \\nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \\nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \\nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \\nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \\na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \\nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \\nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \\nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \\ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\\'s Condor \\nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \\n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \\nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \\npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \\nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \\nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \\nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \\nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \\nsystem).  \\n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \\nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \\nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \\nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \\nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \\nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \\nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \\nfunding for hardware. \\n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \\nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \\nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \\nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \\nthe country in the 1970\\'s and early 1980\\'s. \\n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \\ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \\ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \\nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \\nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \\nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \\nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \\nin the mid-1980\\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \\ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \\nlagged that of the propulsion system. \\n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \\nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \\nsatellite will study the Earth\\'s upper atmosphere and includes \\ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \\nyet been selected, but OSC\\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \\nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \\ncontract.] \\n\\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \\nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \\nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\\'s PA-2 \\nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \\nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \\nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \\noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \\nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \\nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \\nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \"the main \\nalternative rocket supplier\" for the small satellite launch service \\nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \\nSwedish satellite was not specified. \\n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \\nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \\nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \\nPacAstro\\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \\nrockets are built of \"off the shelf\" components based upon the Lunar \\nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \\n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \\n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \\nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \\n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \\nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \\nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \\nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \\nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \\nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \\nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \\nboard of directors.  \\n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \\n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \\nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \\ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \\n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \\nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \\nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \\nhardware.] \\n\\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \\nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \\nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \\nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \\nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \\nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \\ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \\nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \\nsatellite\\'s communications channels.  \\n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \\nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \\nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \\nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \\nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \\nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \\nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \\nM) through 2006.  \\n   I haven\\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \\nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \\nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \\ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \\nseparate sastellite ventures. \\n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \"Asiasat-\\n2\", but I don\\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \\nHong Kong-based \"Asiasat\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \\nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \\nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \\nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \\nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \\nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \\nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \\nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \\nproceed. \\n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \\nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \\nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \\n\\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\\n   South Korea\\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \\nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \\nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \\nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \\nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \\nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \\n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\\'s \\naerospace technology to the level of the world\\'s top 10 countries by \\n2000.                                 \\n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \\nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \\nactivities. I\\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \\ncoming into the commercial space market. \\n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \\nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \\non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \\ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \\nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \\n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \\nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \\n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \\nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \"made in Korea.\"  \\nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \\n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \\nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \\nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \\ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \\noptical and microwave sensors.\\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \\nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \\nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \\ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \\nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \\nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \\nKorean peninsula.       \\n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \\nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \\naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \\noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \\npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \\nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \\nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \\nannounced teaming for production of OSC\\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \\n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \\nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \\nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \\nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \\nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \\n\\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \\nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \\ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \\nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \\nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \\nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \\ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \\nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \\nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \\ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \\nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \\nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \\nresults in all of 1993.

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE\\n    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest.

For the most up to date information on upcoming\\n    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.\\n\\n    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news\\n    frequently.\\n\\n\\n    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?\\n\\n    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks\\n    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).\\n\\n    The \"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\" ASC G&C 2102,\\n\\n\\t\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\\n\\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\\n\\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\n\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\n\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\n\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\n\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\n\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\n\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\n\\n\\tStation    VHF\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tW6FXN\\t 145.46\\n\\tK6MF\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tWA3NAN\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tW5RRR\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tW1AW\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\n\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from\\nIapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about\\nthe rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy\\nand Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.

Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3\\n  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with\\n  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something\\n  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.\\n\\n  Jay\\n\\nand again:\\n\\n  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet\\n  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would\\n  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and\\n  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a\\n  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't\\n  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are\\n  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One\\n  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.\\n\\njay\",\n",

He gave a brief\\noverview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of\\nabout 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then\\ngave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is \\nthat there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer\\nsolar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind;\\nover time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got\\nscattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter\\nand Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially\\nUranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune -\\nwe call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,\\nalready-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through\\nNeptune\\'s atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].\\n\\n  He notes that the two recently discovered \"Kuiper Belt\" objects,\\n1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same \\nmass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the\\nlarger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,\\nformed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material\\ninto a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to\\nideas about the formation of Earth\\'s moon.  There is good evidence\\nfrom spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different\\n(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn\\'t), which can be used as evidence\\nfor the impact theory.\\n\\n  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects\\nremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune\\'s \\norbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members\\nof this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies\\nwill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane \\nfrost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons\\nby now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)\\nis that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,\\nand when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms\\nbright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going\\nto be very hard to see.\\n\\n  I hope I haven\\'t made any errors in the transcription; if you see\\na howling mistake, it\\'s undoubtedly mine, not his.\\n\\n  By the way, he\\'s one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby\\nmission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a\\nTitan 4 to send the probe on \"just about a rectilinear trajectory\"\\nto Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire\\ncelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)\\nswing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.\\n\\n2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\\n\\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\\n\\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\\nindex is near the optimal level.\\n\\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\\n\\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 260 hours\\n\\n\\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\\n\\n1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\\nnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS\\ndata from this test are being conducted.

The\\nday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics\\ncovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for\\nthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; the\\nassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management\\noptions and operations concepts also were held.\\n\\nThe Design Teams then presented the three options under study:\\n\\n¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest\\nsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has\\nidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended\\nand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed\\nto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable\\ncapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified\\nFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing\\nsystems such as the so-called \"Bus-1 spacecraft,\" the orbiter and Spacelab.\\n\\nThe Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom\\nphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab\\nmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.\\n\\nHuman Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.\\nCommon Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking\\nports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter\\ndocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different\\noperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.\\n\\n¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option\\nB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,\\nfrom initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent\\nHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent\\nHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the\\nbaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking\\nsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data\\nManagement System.\\n\\nInitial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree\\ninclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration\\norbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic\\narrays providing 18.75 kW of power.\\n\\nHuman-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss\\nsegments and the U.S. lab.\\n\\nPermanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two\\norbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.\\n\\nTwo Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other\\nsection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and\\npropulsion systems.\\n\\nThe freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete\\nstate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,\\na third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete\\nthe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.\\n\\nGriffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware\\nwould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived\\noption.

A Shuttle external tank and solid\\nrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle\\nmain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch\\nand jettisoned after ET separation.\\n\\nThe module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000\\ncubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 \"decks\" connected by a\\ncentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various\\nplaces on the circumference of the module to place the international\\nmodules, and other elements.  This \"can\" would have two fixed photo voltaic\\narrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial\\nattitude.\\n\\nIn his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O\\'Connor\\nsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so\\nthat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the\\nRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.\\n\\nRussian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space\\nexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members\\nof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space\\nAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. \\nOthers on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,\\nthe Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the\\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team\\nbriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking\\nsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the\\nSoyuz TM spacecraft.\\n\\nThe Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities\\nof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian\\ncapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will\\nbe available to the SRT through May 5.\\n\\nManagement and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT\\nsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to\\ndevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a\\nfoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various\\nmanagement options have been developed including:\\n\\n¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of\\ncommand.\\n\\n¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate\\nAdministrator.\\n\\n¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located\\nhand-picked program office.\\n\\n¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an\\nelement of the current program.\\n\\n¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and\\ngeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.\\n\\nThe Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the\\nOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had\\nalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its\\npreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.\\n\\nAs part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency\\nexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of\\nassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing\\nand ground operations.\\n\\nWhat\\'s in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a\\ncomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday\\nand Tuesday at which point the design will be \"frozen\" to begin the\\ndetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing\\nfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to\\nbe held May 3.\\n\\nDr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the\\nStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O\\'Connor will take over the\\nactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant\\ndeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve\\nas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to\\nconsult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request\\nfrom Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.\\n\\nKey Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being\\ncarried on the schedule are:\\n\\nApril 26\\nDesign Freeze on Options for Costing\\n\\nApril 27\\nDesign Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT\\n\\nMay 3\\nStatus report to Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\nMay 15\\nInterim report by Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\nJune 7\\nFinal report to Redesign Advisory Committee\\n',\n",

Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.',\n",

This\\nsummarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300\\nparticipants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in\\nSeville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by\\nthe European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for\\nthe Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).\\n\\nOLYMPUS has been particularly useful :\\n-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of\\n       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small\\n       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested\\n       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,\\n       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few\\n       examples.\\n\\n-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services\\n       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-\\n       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over\\n       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.\\n\\n-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS\\n       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,\\n       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and\\n       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.\\n\\nWhen OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the\\nworld\\'s largest telecommunications satellite; and no other\\nsatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four\\ndifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.\\n\\nOLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some\\nof the world\\'s largest businesses. Access to the satellite is\\ngiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques or\\nservices; over the past four years some 200 companies and\\norganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over\\n100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning\\norganisation.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the new technologies and services tested by these\\nOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then\\nmake use of operational satellites such as those of\\nEUTELSAT.',\n",

Dave Winfield,\\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don\\'t \\nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn\\'t field,\\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\\nOBP wasn\\'t THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \\n\\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80\\'s.  I know that\\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn\\'t overrated by the media.  \\n\\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one\\'s actually pretty close.  He\\'s had a s\\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \\n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I\\'d have to take a closer look at the stats (it\\'s been \\na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \\n\\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn\\'t mean a whole hell of a lot if you \\nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \\nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \\nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\\n\\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF\\'er.\\n\\n\\n\\tLemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN\\'T marginal?\\n\\n\\n\\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he\\'s won something along\\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \\ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie\\'s more\\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\\n80\\'s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie\\'s\\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power (\\'cept against Tom Niedenfuer\\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\\n\\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\\nstiff.  His \\'82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\\nSS numbers go.  He\\'s a clear HOF\\'er, IMHO.\\n\\n\\n\\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you\\'re right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \\ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn\\'t be in the HOF.\\n\\tSkyJack?  I\\'ve said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\\nabout Morris\\' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris\\' \"ability\\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in \\'93, he may be damned \\nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\\n80\\'s for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\\nnot favorites.  Morris\\' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\\n\"consideration\".  \\n\\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \\nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he\\'s \\njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\\n(Of course, Nolan\\'s a HOF\\'er...)\\n\\tPuck?  Probably, although he\\'s got to play reasonably well for a few\\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren\\'t enough to make the HOF, most\\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \\ntragic or sudden).  He\\'s very popular in the media and with fans, and\\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF\\'s in the game since he joined the\\nleague.  I\\'ve always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.

My impression is that sportcasters and writers have made this\\nan issue because they like shorter games - they get to head back to hotel\\nbar, eat steaks, get drunk, tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase\\nstewardesses around the bar.  Sure they want the game over with.  Print \\njournalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games:\\nthey have deadlines.  The ESPN guys on baseball tonight drive me crazy - they\\nconstantly harp on this - primarily because they often have to work late \\nwhen the game goes longer than 2:30.\\n\\n\\tMaybe I am just a ne\\'er-do-well with nothing better to do, but I \\nwould like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you.\\n\\n\\tAs a parenthetical note, it seems the league is in any case fighting\\na losing battle this year.

They should finish\\nover .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race \\nin August.  However, I would take back a few moves:\\n\\n1.  The Jim Abbott Trade.\\n    I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a\\n    great pitcher also.  He could win the Cy Young this year, \\n    but he won't because the right side of the Yanks infield\\n    isn't good enough.  So why was this not a good trade?  \\n    JT Snow.  How many rookies have been able to step in and\\n    immediately have the impact that he has had so far on \\n    the Angels?  I know it's early, but if you've seen this kid\\n    hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be \\n    a tremendous player.  The Yanks should have kept him.  What\\n    about Mattingly, you ask?  Well - it's great that the Yanks\\n    have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years\\n    older than Snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as\\n    before his back injury.  It's a shame, but as a Yankee fan \\n    who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I'd take \\n    Snow over Mattingly at first.  The Yanks also gave up two\\n    promising propects with Snow for Abbott.  Besides, with\\n    Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling\\n    Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects.  I know Abbotts\\n    only 26, but this was too much to give up.  I believe George\\n    forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that\\n    Abbott will be a big hit in NY.  However, I'd like to see the\\n    Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show.\\n\\n2.  Wade Boggs.\\n    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot.  But, his career is \\n    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop\\n    a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?).\\n    Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range.  What a shame about\\n    Charlie Hayes, huh?\\n\\n3.  Spike Owen.\\n    See Wade Boggs.  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri\\n    or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is\\n    going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys\\n    are on the down sides of their careers.\\n\\n4.  Danny Tartabull.\\n    Yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think\\n    about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year.  But he\\n    never is.  We should expect 120 games max out of him.  Meanwhile,\\n    Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing\\n    left field!  I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists\\n    last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.\\n\\nWhat I'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right\\ndirection but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year.  They should\\n(at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series.  This\\nmeans getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they \\nwill be ready in a year or two.  \\n\\nI'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner.\\nCertainly, the Boggs deal was all George.  It looks like George is\\nplanning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world\\nseries now.  The veterans are always available and can be added at any\\ntime (like Boston did this year).  Develop the young players first,\\nthen add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep\\nthem).  Let's all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn't dismantle\\nthe terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee\\norganization back into one of respect.  I'm really afraid that he will\\ntrade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for\\nexample).

              "  '\\nUntil six or seven years ago I was an enthusiastic fan of NFL football.\\nLast year I hardly watched a game.  What turned me off were the\\nincessant interruptions to the continuity of the game.  A team scores.\\n2.5 minutes of commercials.  Kickoff.  1.5 minutes of commercials.\\nThree downs and a punt.  2 minutes of commercials.  AAAAARRRRGH!\\n\\nEarlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A\\'s, whom I\\nbelieve institutionalize slow play.  I don\\'t mind the cat-and-mouse\\ngame with Rickey on first;  in fact, I rather enjoy it.  Similarly\\nI would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first.  What\\nI object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first,\\nor when the game is a blowout.  I don\\'t mind when the pitcher steps off \\nthe mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation, or when a hitter\\nsteps out of the box to regain his concentration.  What I object to\\nis when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity.\\nWhen a game is exciting, these little delays serve as tension builders\\nand for me enhance the value of the experience of the game.  When the\\ndelays happen with regularity, they become nuisances, just like the\\ncommercial breaks in football.  \\n\\nI understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to \"speed up\"\\nthe games, basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move\\nthe markers and the ball to the spots faster.  That did not address\\nthe problem of the continuity of the game.  It may have appeased the\\nsponsors and the networks, but I would be amazed if it did anything\\nto enhance the experience of the fans.\\n\\nSimilary, while some 3-hour baseball games bore me to tears, those are the\\nones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly\\nlong periods to get ready for each pitch.  I doubt if anyone watching\\nthe Braves-Giants game cared about Gant stepping out.  I doubt if anyone\\nwatching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an\\nopportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that\\nwas present.  I would be totally opposed to any effort that would\\neliminate that aspect of baseball.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful\\nenough to sit down with Alderson/LaRussa/Duncan and explain that they\\nare actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games \\nout the way that they do.

              "  '\\nThis is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding\\nof what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth\\'s\\natmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive\\nanswer is \"photosynthesis\", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis\\nby itself can\\'t make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced\\nis consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed\\nis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of\\nthe resulting reduced material.\\n\\nOn earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic\\nmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires\\ncontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow\\nthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).\\n\\nThis suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without\\ncontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating\\nan oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a\\nhard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.\\n\\nThere is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth\\'s atmosphere\\nhas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least\\n2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to\\nweathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback\\nmechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak\\nanthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen\\nlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn\\'t be here to be wondering about\\nit.',\n",

Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe \\n    for the planet Venus. \\n\\n        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing\\n    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the\\n    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic\\n    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core\\n    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of\\n    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by\\n    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels\\n    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large\\n    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The\\n    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger \\n    to properly transmit this information to Earth. \\n\\n        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed\\n    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)\\n    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a\\n    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by \\n    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus\\'\\n    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). \\n\\n        The Soviet probes\\' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over\\n    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects \\n    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the\\n    VENERAs\\' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations \\n    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the \\n    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern\\n    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or \\n    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially \\n    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.\\n\\n        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 \\n    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, \\n    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a \\n    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around \\n    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA \\n    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus\\' \\n    first polar-circling spacecraft.\\n\\n        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 \\n    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north\\n    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers \\n    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  \\n    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over \\n    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back \\n    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took \\n    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions \\n    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers \\n    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more\\n    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, \\n    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, \\n    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the \\n    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean \\n    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the \\n    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids \\n    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) \\n    across, due to Venus\\' very dense atmosphere.\\n\\n        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists\\n    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes\\' \\n    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \\n    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest \\n    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American \\n    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell \\n    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern \"continent\" of Ishtar Terra.  \\n\\n        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about\\n    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later\\n    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar\\n    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-\\n    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be \\n    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan \\n    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even \\n    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet \\n    probes maintained that distinction.\\n\\n        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted\\n    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the \\n    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world\\'s\\n    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about\\n    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few\\n    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \\n    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds \\n    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \\n    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty \\n    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees \\n    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.\\n\\n        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were \\n    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at \\n    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to \\n    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control\\n    gas to perform the operation.  \\n\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving \\n    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six \\n    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an \\n    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.\\n\\n        Venus by Balloon\\n\\n        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting \\n    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet\\'s mantle of \\n    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of \\n    the French space agency Centre National d\\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)\\n    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint \\n    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, \\n    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.\\n\\n        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, \\n    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full \\n    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe \\n    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.\\n\\n        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named\\n    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei\\n    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft \\n    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one \\n    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  \\n\\n        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to \\n    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.\\n    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from\\n    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists \\n    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such \\n    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  \\n\\n        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar \\n    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall \\n    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice \\n    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar \\n    encounter.\\n\\n        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and\\n    Japan\\'s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not\\n    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a\\n    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical\\n    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the \\n    comet, while Japan\\'s first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and \\n    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. \\n\\n        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet\\n    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel\\n    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget\\n    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to\\n    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of \\n    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter \\n    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor \\n    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.\\n\\n        The Soviets\\' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building\\n    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify\\n    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an \\n    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,\\n    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of \\n    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the \\n    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. \\n    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the \\n    location of the comet\\'s erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive \\n    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.\\n\\n        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA\\n    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander\\n    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the\\n    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers\\n    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released\\n    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)\\n    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had\\n    successfully arrived. \\n\\n        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was\\n    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a\\n    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen\\n    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as\\n    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat\\n    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment\\n    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,\\n    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for\\n    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special\\n    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which\\n    permeated the planet\\'s atmosphere. \\n\\n        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just\\n    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag \\n    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened \\n    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  \\n    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as \\n    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  \\n    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar \\n    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists \\n    had thought the planet\\'s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight \\n    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.\\n\\n        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day\\n    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600\\n    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did\\n    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer\\n    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers\\n    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three\\n    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the\\n    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers\\n    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and\\n    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the\\n    journey.  The layer\\'s air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius\\n    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.\\n    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. \\n\\n        Early in the first balloon\\'s flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already\\n    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with\\n    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 \\n    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the\\n    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the\\n    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen\\n    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to \\n    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 \\n    miles) above the surface. \\n\\n        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before\\n    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not\\n    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of\\n    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never \\n    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature \\n    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees \\n    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander\\'s \\n    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background \\n    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.\\n\\n        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and \\n    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data\\n    returned during the lander\\'s plunge through the atmosphere.  The\\n    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, \\n    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active \\n    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.\\n    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air\\n    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)\\n    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.\\n\\n        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks \\n    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.\\n    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2\\'s results\\n    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers \\n    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were \\n    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 \\n    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a\\n    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), \\n    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-\\n    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air \\n    over the last seven years.\\n\\n        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last \\n    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on\\n    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around\\n    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March\\n    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the \\n    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.\\n    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial\\n    bodies with one space vessel.\\n\\n        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for\\n    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2\\n    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking\\n    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning\\n    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)\\n    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still\\n    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.\\n    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent \\n    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-\\n    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the \"continent\" of Aphrodite \\n    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 \\n    miles) towards the surface.\\n\\n        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air \\n    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius \\n    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1\\n    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed \\n    through the balloon\\'s level.  No positive indications of lightning\\n    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat\\'s nephelometer \\n    failed to function.\\n\\n        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite\\n    Terra\\'s western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900\\n    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander\\'s resting place was smoother\\n    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a\\n    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in\\n    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, \\n    rare on Earth but present in Luna\\'s highlands.  This rock is rich in \\n    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree \\n    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured \\n    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,\\n    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.\\n\\n        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at\\n    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin \\n    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 \\n    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet \\n    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers \\n    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three \\n    hours.\\n\\n        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley\\n    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the \\n    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-\\n    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance \\n    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets \\n    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly \\n    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was \\n    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  \\n    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.\\n\\n        Future Plans Diverted\\n\\n        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous \\n    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second \\n    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for\\n    the early 1990s.\\n\\n        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple \\n    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft \\n    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon \\n    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet\\'s \\n    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over \\n    the VEGA balloons\\' two days.  The mission would then head out to \\n    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible \\n    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main \\n    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.\\n\\n        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in\\n    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA\\n    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet\\n    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space \\n    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction \\n    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this \\n    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next \\n    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on\\n    Mars\\' largest moon, Phobos. \\n\\n        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,\\n    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and \\n    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.\\n    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious\\n    consideration of human colonization in the near future.\\n\\n        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars\\n    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,\\n    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other\\n    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon\\n    landing in March of 1989. \\n\\n        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to\\n    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the\\n    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put \\n    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have\\n    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of\\n    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. \\n\\n        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change\\n    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began \\n    to \"open up\" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with \\n    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the \\n    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking \\n    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a \"free market\".\\n\\n        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.\\n    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making\\n    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring\\n    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to \\n    make money.  \\n\\n        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for \\n    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price \\n    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary \\n    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United \\n    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.\\n\\n        MAGELLAN and GALILEO \\n\\n        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration\\n    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.\\n    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of\\n    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most \\n    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When\\n    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be\\n    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108\\n    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.\\n\\n        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space \\n    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit \\n    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle \\n    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, \\n    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the \\n    probe\\'s primary target\\'s major moons in 1610.\\n\\n        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on\\n    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around\\n    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach\\n    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO\\'s first planetary\\n    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the\\n    planet\\'s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in\\n    that violent atmosphere.\\n\\n        On the Drawing Boards\\n\\n        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,\\n    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-\\n    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet \\n    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, \\n    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions \\n    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also\\n    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.\\n\\n        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects \\n    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes\\n    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected\\n    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing\\n    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air\\n    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed\\n    to study Venus\\' atmosphere while descending through the thick air\\n    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.\\n    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.\\n\\n        Humans on Venus      \\n\\n        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?\\n    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure\\n    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something\\n    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into\\n    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like\\n    Earth\\'s.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking\\n    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide \\n    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability \\n    to speed up the planet\\'s rotation rate to something a bit faster\\n    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries\\n    if not millennia.\\n\\n        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand\\n    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how\\n    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became\\n    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?\\n    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found\\n    through international cooperation, including the nation which \\n    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.\\n\\n        Bibliography -\\n\\n         Barsukov, V.

The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`~sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n=================   ==========\\nClasses                     20\\nSamples total            18846\\nDimensionality               1\\nFeatures                  text\\n=================   ==========\\n\\n.. dropdown:: Usage\\n\\n  The :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\n  fetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\n  the original `20 newsgroups website <http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/>`__,\\n  extracts the archive contents\\n  in the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n  :func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\n  testing set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n    >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n    >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n    >>> from pprint import pprint\\n    >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n    [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n     \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n     \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n     \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n     \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n     \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n     \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n     \\'rec.autos\\',\\n     \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n     \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n     \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n     \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n     \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n     \\'sci.med\\',\\n     \\'sci.space\\',\\n     \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n     \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n     \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n     \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n     \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\n  The real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\n  attribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n    >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n    (11314,)\\n    >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n    (11314,)\\n    >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n    array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\n  It is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\n  list of the categories to load to the\\n  :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n    >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n    >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n    >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n    [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n    >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n    (1073,)\\n    >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n    (1073,)\\n    >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n    array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\n.. dropdown:: Converting text to vectors\\n\\n  In order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\n  one first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\n  for statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\\n  ``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\\n  example that extract `TF-IDF <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf>`__ vectors\\n  of unigram tokens from a subset of 20news::\\n\\n    >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\\n    >>> categories = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'talk.religion.misc\\',\\n    ...               \\'comp.graphics\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n    >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n    ...                                       categories=categories)\\n    >>> vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\\n    >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n    >>> vectors.shape\\n    (2034, 34118)\\n\\n  The extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\\n  components by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\\n  (less than .5% non-zero features)::\\n\\n    >>> vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\\n    159.01327...\\n\\n  :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which\\n  returns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\\n\\n.. dropdown:: Filtering text for more realistic training\\n\\n  It is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\\n  20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\\n  high F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\n  aren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\n  For example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\n  which is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n    >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n    >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n    >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n    ...                                      categories=categories)\\n    >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n    >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n    >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n    MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n    >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n    >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n    0.88213...\\n\\n  (The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\n  the training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\n  multinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\n  yet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\n  Let\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n    >>> import numpy as np\\n    >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n    ...     feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\\n    ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n    ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n    ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n    ...\\n    >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n    alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n    comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n    sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n    talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\n  You can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n  - Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n    ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n  - Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n    a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n  - The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n    previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n    wrote:\"\\n  - Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n    were posting at the time.\\n\\n  With such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\n  barely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\n  same high level.\\n\\n  For this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\n  parameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\n  of each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n  ``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\n  blocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n    >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n    ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n    ...                                      categories=categories)\\n    >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n    >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n    >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n    0.77310...\\n\\n  This classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\n  metadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\n  It loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n    >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n    ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n    ...                                       categories=categories)\\n    >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n    >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n    >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n    MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n    >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n    >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n    >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n    0.76995...\\n\\n  Some other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try the\\n  :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n  example with and without the `remove` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. rubric:: Data Considerations\\n\\nThe Cleveland Indians is a major league baseball team based in Cleveland,\\nOhio, USA. In December 2020, it was reported that \"After several months of\\ndiscussion sparked by the death of George Floyd and a national reckoning over\\nrace and colonialism, the Cleveland Indians have decided to change their\\nname.\" Team owner Paul Dolan \"did make it clear that the team will not make\\nits informal nickname -- the Tribe -- its new team name.\" \"It\\'s not going to\\nbe a half-step away from the Indians,\" Dolan said.\"We will not have a Native\\nAmerican-themed name.\"\\n\\nhttps://www.mlb.com/news/cleveland-indians-team-name-change\\n\\n.. rubric:: Recommendation\\n\\n- When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this\\n  by setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n- This text dataset contains data which may be inappropriate for certain NLP\\n  applications. An example is listed in the \"Data Considerations\" section\\n  above. The challenge with using current text datasets in NLP for tasks such\\n  as sentence completion, clustering, and other applications is that text\\n  that is culturally biased and inflammatory will propagate biases. This\\n  should be taken into consideration when using the dataset, reviewing the\\n  output, and the bias should be documented.\\n\\n.. rubric:: Examples\\n\\n* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_hashing_vs_dict_vectorizer.py`\\n* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_clustering.py`\\n'}"

Since he didn\\'t disclose it, the Sharks and\\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\\nhim down to K.C.

An obvious difference is that in such a\\ntransient period, the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling\\nover Cabbage Patch Dolls^TM as we\\'ve seen recently as opposed by\\nrationing by ability to pay ... but the former is a *transient*\\nsituation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the\\nCalifornia health infrastructure, the same would result --- rationing\\namong the insured population.  With smaller markets, there is much\\nless flexibility when dealing with our insured population than\\nCalifornia (which by the way, has 1/3rd more people than Canada in a\\nMUCH more dense area).  So he is correct in that the resources are\\nfixed (for a particular time window, or as a function of the doctors\\nmonopoly licencing according to the market steady state) in either\\ncase.  As for being \"refused treatment\" the government of the day\\nwould be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen;\\nCanadians can be geographically bad, too, not realizing that their\\nhealth care is private while only their insurance isn\\'t ... too many\\npeople have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized\\nmedicine.\\n\\n\\nRight, as I\\'ve pointed out above ...\\n\\n\\nEither way, the transient situations are hard to deal with since the\\nchanges in the private medical care resource take place at a slower\\nrate than the ability of people to fall sick esp. in the light of\\ndisasters (e.g., Chernobyl) or bad luck (a sudden wave of heart\\ndisease). A doctor needs 4-6 years of training, plus internship \\nand specialty training.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s why I\\'ve argued for deductible and copayments rather than\\neducation, which is what most Canadian fiscal conservatives are\\narguing for (the leftists?  \"Ah, just let \\'em spend!\" --- yeah,\\nright!).  Also, note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions\\nunder some high dollar threshold ... in most, it\\'s your private\\ninsurance that covers it just like in the U.S.  Still, it all\\nadds up in the OECD measures.\\n\\n\\nWe get the Sabres\\' feed as a replacement game on ESPN tonight (the\\nDevils\\' local metro NY coverage supplants the main ESPN game).\\n\\n\\nYeah, it\\'s a sad story and Saskatchewan Tory leader Grant Devine\\nhas been on a nonstop PR campaign to save his sorry butt.

Also, Singapore has a much\\nmore autocratic mentality which has seaped down into its masses\\n(if Singaporeans that I\\'ve met are any indication ... I don\\'t\\nmean any disprespect here) where they\\'d let you just die.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s true ... the question is how much leeway is there between\\nthe U.S. approach and the second-most capitalist approaches of\\nCanada, France and Germany.\\n\\n\\nYes, many ... and pretty close to a lot of smaller towns or not too\\nfar from a bigger town.  Just take a look at a detailed atlas ...\\nor better, take a flight from Pittsburgh or Rochester to Toronto.\\nMy first time across Lake Ontario to NYC, I was amazed by the\\nincrease in density ... and the Toronto region is the densest \\nin all of Canada.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s about time!  I\\'ve ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they\\ndon\\'t invest in their own private practices ... in the end, it\\'s their\\nmoney.  But they choose to spend it on America\\'s Cup pipedreams, and\\nthat\\'s none of my business.  As for \"provincially owned\" ... for sure\\nit\\'s against the law in Canada for governments to be directly involved\\nin the provision of health care except in the military or native reser-\\nvations.  What that term actually means is that the facility gets by\\non public grants to meet shortfall from *lack of use* ... no kidding.\\nMedical practice itself is much more conservative up north.  My own\\nbest friend did two clerkships at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN,\\nand is no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat comes first.\\n\\n\\nNo, it\\'s probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have\\nprivate practices ... and always have.  They can all take cash\\nanyways ... so why not have a particular facility?  The Canadian\\nbig government mentality often imagines government where it does\\nnot even exist ...\\n\\nSince the French and Germans have become more entrepreneurial and less\\nlaidback without sacrificing their culture and values, then Canadians\\ncan do the same.  As I\\'ve pointed out above, the law states that it is\\nillegal for the *government* to provide any health services except for\\nthe military and natives.\\n\\nLook, nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the MRI ...\\nnobody stopped them when they bought it.

Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere\\ndissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.\\n\\nThat someone could go to the government and insist that the government make\\nus stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing\\nwhat we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression.\\nAnd it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.\\n\\nThis does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decency\\nand common sense.  A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty.\\nAnd yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving or\\nrejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike me\\nas a wonderful way to improve the human condition.',\n",

He's been talking extensively with his foreign policy \\nadvisors, his Bosnia advisors, as well as with other world leaders.  \\nHe'll try to contact President Mitterrand again today, and he'll \\ncontinue to discuss it.  We don't have any specific timetable, but \\nobviously the situation there is very serious.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has he called Janet Reno today or yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS.

We can talk a \\nlittle later about the exact structure as we work it out.  But I \\ndon't know if it's something you'd want to take live.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will he take questions on Waco at that time as \\nwell?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He'll probably take a few.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there any reason why he hasn't talked to the \\nAttorney General?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I'll have to double-check.  I don't know \\nthat he hasn't talked to her this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And she didn't come here this morning to see him or \\nanyone else?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And he didn't talk yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What's the reaction to her resignation statement \\nthat she made last night?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  She was asked a question about it, and she \\nanswered the question.  The President has absolutely no intention of \\nasking for the Attorney General's resignation.  He stands behind her \\n100 percent.  As you know, he was informed about the decision.  He \\ntakes full responsibility for that, and stands 100 percent behind \\nAttorney General Reno.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The question now arises -- yesterday we were told \\nthat he was briefed on this, but we never got a firm idea of how much \\nhe knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and \\nthe justification of the timing.  Was he fully informed on all of \\nthat, all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the \\ncompound that made them want to go now, the feeling that nothing else \\nwas going to succeed, et cetera?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He talked with the Attorney General about \\nthe decision, about -- she talked to him about the factors that led \\nto her decision.  He raised no objections.  He supports her decision \\nto go forward with it.  He was fully briefed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Of course, hindsight is 20-20, but looking back \\nnow, does the President, does the White House feel that the decision \\nhe signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at \\nwhat actually happened?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think everybody feels bad when life is \\nlost.  But I don't think that that is reason to second-guess the \\ndecision.  He stands behind the decision that was made.  He was \\ninformed about it.  He was fully briefed about it and he stands 100 \\npercent behind the Attorney General, the Justice Department and the \\nFBI.  It's a difficult operation and there's -- it had already gone \\non for more than seven weeks.  Four federal agents had lost their \\nlives in the line of duty -- let's not forget that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This was a very difficult situation and all the \\ndecisions involved were very difficult.  But all the agents on the \\nground, the FBI, the Justice Department all recommended moving \\nforward with this.  They thought, given the circumstances, it was the \\nbest possible course of action.  There's just no point in second-\\nguessing those decisions.  Now, I think that there's a reason --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?  They have to --\\n\\t     \\n\\x0c\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, not to second-guess the decisions.  I \\nthink it's important to take a look at it, to have an investigation.  \\nI think the President will talk some about that later today.  But at \\nthis -- from this vantage point, to second-guess those decisions, \\nit's not useful.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You sound like he's going to order an investigation \\nof what happened and whether --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think he'll have more to say about that \\nlater, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He will order an investigation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He'll have more -- yes -- he'll have more to \\nsay about an investigation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What kind of investigation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He'll have more to say about it later.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But in the Monday morning quarterbacking, surely \\nthere is some soul-searching now as to whether it was the right \\ndecision.  You can't say that we did the best we could when it turned \\nout to be a rather -- a debacle.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:   I think we'll -- obviously, we'll review \\nthe situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome.  \\nI don't think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic.  But, \\nagain, the President stands behind the decisions that were made and \\nwe'll take a look at the factors that contributed to that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What was the FBI Director's role in this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, he was obviously involved in setting \\nup the operation.  He signed off on it, as did the agents that were \\non the ground that were working with him.  I don't believe he spoke \\nto the President, but I'll double-check that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But he was very closely involved in every aspect of \\nplanning and so forth?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what \\naspects he was involved with.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House \\ntoday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There's no planned meeting.  I don't believe \\nthat she'll be here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  She won't be at this event at 1:15 p.m.?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, no plans to be.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think that there's going to be a jumping on \\non the part of political opposition to make something out of this in \\nterms of -- to the President's detriment politically?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I would certainly hope that people \\nwouldn't try to use this tragedy for political reasons.  Obviously, I \\nthink, again, that it's useful to look at the facts, to reevaluate \\nthe facts, and I think the President will move forward with that.  \\nBut I think people understand that this was a difficult series of \\ndecisions; that it was a very difficult situation; that it was caused \\nby a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four \\nfederal agents.   And I think it's most tragic that a lot of innocent \\n\\x0c\\nchildren lost their lives in this.  I don't think anybody disputes \\nthe tragedy of the outcome.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, what was the White House role in handling \\nthe, I guess, public relations aspect  in the aftermath?  Who was \\ntalking -- who here at the White House was talking with people at \\nJustice to set up Reno's news conference, to do all that sort of \\nthing?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the Attorney General handled her end \\nof the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the \\nnews conference once there was a point at which there was enough \\ninformation, I think, to talk with some accuracy about what had \\ntranspired during the day.  Obviously, people here at a number of \\nlevels were keeping in touch with people at the Justice Department \\nand at the FBI to try to keep informed about what was happening \\nthere.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But Reno said that she didn't talk to the \\nPresident, and there seemed to be an indication she hadn't talked to \\nanybody at the White House.  So who --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There were people talking on a staff-to-\\nstaff level.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I understand.  But who at the Justice Department \\nwas handling that for Reno?  Who was talking to the White House?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There were a number of people.  As you know, \\nWebb Hubbell is the liaison to the White House, and I know he talked \\nto a number of people here.  There were a number of people at a \\nnumber of different levels involved.  I don't want to get into \\nexactly who had what conversations with whom, but there were a number \\nof conversations.  Obviously, the Justice Department was working to \\nkeep the White House informed, the press informed to the best of its \\nability as events unfolded throughout the day.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  I don't know if he \\ntalked -- he may have at one point.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And was the White House role just to seek \\ninformation about what happened, or was it to direct the public \\ninformation campaign that followed?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It was both to keep abreast of the situation \\nso the President could be on top of it, but I think the Justice \\nDepartment managed its press relations on it.  We were obviously very \\ninterested in what was happening there throughout the day, and the \\nPresident was following it very closely throughout the day.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, on that, though, if the President was \\nfollowing it so closely and he had talked the night before with Janet \\nReno, why wouldn't he talk to her at all since then?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know if he's talked to her \\nthis morning.  Again, he's kept fully aware of what has been going on \\nthroughout the day.  He stands 100 percent behind her decisions.  \\nHe's been fully supportive of her, as he said yesterday morning \\nbefore events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written \\nstatement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But wouldn't he want to convey those thoughts to \\nher personally yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  One more time, I don't know if they've \\nspoken this morning.\\n\\x0c\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Clearly there's a perception that she was left hung \\nout to dry all day yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  That's just not true.  I think we said \\nthroughout the day that the President takes full responsibility, that \\nhe stands -- I don't know how much clearer we can be.  The President \\nstands foursquare behind the Attorney General on this.  He accepts \\nfull responsibility for the events that transpired.  He believes that \\nJanet Reno, the Justice Department, and the FBI acted as best they \\ncould, given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the \\ntime.  I don't know what else he can say to show that he supports her \\n1,000 percent.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  One of the best indications of that is to pick up \\nthe phone and tell her.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know whether they've spoken \\nthis morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why can't we find out?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, we can.  I can't do it standing here \\nright now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You've got six people here.  All they've got to do \\nis pick up the phone.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Helen, we'll get back to you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, when the President spoke with the Attorney \\nGeneral on Sunday, is it safe to assume that either she volunteered \\nor he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to \\nincreasing pressure on the Davidians?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they discussed the situation.  \\nAgain, I'm not going to get into the specific details of what exactly \\nshe told him, but I think that he was aware of the risks involved.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, the President yesterday morning said it \\nwas entirely her decision.  She then said that she told him what was \\nhappening and he said, okay.  Does the President regard it that he \\ngave the go-ahead or that she gave the go-ahead?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think what they both said yesterday was \\nthat she made a decision based on all the available facts.  She \\ninformed him about that and he raised no objections.  Again, I don't \\nknow how much clearer we can be about that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And he said, okay.  The issue is over the \\nresponsibility.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He said, okay.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t   Does okay mean --\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The President accepts ultimate \\nresponsibility.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, the President's investigation that he's \\ngoing to announce -- would that be conducted by someone outside the \\nadministration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\x0c\\n\\t     Q\\t  It would be internal -- is it meant to preclude any \\ncongressional investigation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, it's meant simply to follow up on the \\nincidents that occurred yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And you would, I assume, therefore, cooperate fully \\nwith any congressional hearings that would be held?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  To the best of our ability.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, there are two reports out this morning.  \\nOne that the Justice Department, or FBI, or whomever, apparently had \\na bug planted inside the complex.  And the other is that the children \\nmay have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either \\nleft them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire.  \\nWhat do you know about those two --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing more than I've seen in news accounts \\nthis morning.  We may get more on it later, but at this point, I know \\n-- I'm not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by \\npeople who came out of the compound.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has the President received any report today in \\nterms of fatalities and actually what was going on -- what they've \\nbeen able to find out on in the compound now?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He's been briefed.  I don't think that \\nthey've gotten into the compound yet.  They were still waiting for it \\nto cool off.  I don't think there's much beyond what's been reported \\nin the news accounts.  But he has been kept up-to-date on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, the President stands behind Attorney \\nGeneral Reno, but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from \\nthe so-called experts?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He believes that she made -- he stands \\nbehind the decision that she made.  It was the unanimous decision of \\nher advisors, of the FBI, of the agents on the ground, and he \\nsupports that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about the validity of the decisions made on \\nthe ground?  Does he back those --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He's not going to second-guess decisions \\nmade.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, you just said, he stands behind the \\ndecision which she made.  Normally, in a situation like this, the \\nPresident says, I  made the decision.  But you're saying she made the \\ndecision?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm saying that the President was briefed \\nabout the decision.  He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility \\nfor it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But then why do you keep using the terminology, the \\ndecision that she made, rather than the decision that he made --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Because, as he said yesterday, she evaluated \\nthe facts based on evidence presented to her by Justice Department \\nand FBI, which is part of the Justice Department, and made a decision \\nand then briefed the President on that decision.  That is how the \\nchain of command works.  She briefed him.  He signed off on it.  The \\noperation went forward, and the President accepts full \\nresponsibility.\\n\\t     \\n\\x0c\\n\\t     Q\\t  In that chain of command analogy there, I want to \\ngo back to Sessions a moment.  Do you know if this was a plan that \\ncame through him to Reno, or was it presented to her around him or \\nwith his involvement?  What was his involvement?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, you'd have to go to the Justice \\nDepartment for the specific interaction between the Attorney General \\nand the Director.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does the President stand behind Director Sessions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He supports -- again, I don't know how many \\ndifferent ways I can say this -- he supports the decisions made by \\nthe Justice Department and the FBI.  He fully supports the Attorney \\nGeneral in this.  I'm not stepping away from the Director of the FBI, \\nI want to -- but Janet Reno is the one who briefed him, the one who \\nmade the decisions as the head of the Justice Department.  As you \\nknow, the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General.  The \\nAttorney General made the decision.  She informed the President about \\nthose decisions.  He okayed it.  He didn't raise any objections to \\nit, and he accepts full responsibility.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you have, based on what you know here at the \\nWhite House, any concerns about William Sessions' performance during \\nthis --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing to suggest that, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Along those same lines, just in your initial review \\nof the situation, how much do you think the problems might have come \\nfrom not having a Justice Department that's fully staffed and having \\nan FBI Director who is still quite uncertain about his status?    \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I just don't think that had anything to do \\nwith it.  I think the agents on the ground -- the operation went \\nforward.  I'm not going to speculate on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the White House express any alarm that Janet \\nReno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to \\nspeak to Clinton?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:   No.  She was carrying forward her \\nresponsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday.  I \\nthink she did a very admirable job.  The President agrees with that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Before Sunday, how often was the President briefed \\non the situation in Waco?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He was kept updated on a regular basis, on a \\ndaily basis.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Who briefed the President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I'm not going to get into exactly who, \\nwhat conversations he had with whom, but he was kept up-to-date on \\nthe events in Waco.  He has daily briefings on a number of issues.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, no, was this a regular briefing conducted by a \\nWhite House staff person, or was it by a Justice Department person?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He's briefed regularly by a White House \\nstaff on a number of issues.  Again, I'm not going to get into \\nexactly who briefs him on what subjects.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Another subject?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On another subject.\\n\\t     \\n\\x0c\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Now we're going to do gays in the military.  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I welcome it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How close are you to signing the biodiversity \\ntreaty?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the President's giving a speech \\non Earth Day tomorrow.  We'll have more to say about it then.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Any details on where or when that speech is yet?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It's at 11:30 a.m. and I don't know where \\nyet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, is this a major policy address?  How would \\nyou characterize the speech tomorrow?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I would characterize it as a Earth Day \\nspeech.  I wouldn't look for any major departures from his past \\npositions on these things.  But, again, I don't want to get too much \\ninto what he's going to talk about tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On or off campus?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this at a location outside the White House?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It will be somewhere in Washington.  We \\ndon't know exactly where yet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, what foreign leaders has the President \\ntalked to since Friday on the situation in Bosnia? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Only Prime Minister Major.  And again, he'll \\ntry to reach President Mitterrand again this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  David Owen said yesterday and Joe Biden said today \\n-- both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work, \\nthat the Serbs are not going to sign on.  Does the administration \\nstill believe that it can work and that they will sign on?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Obviously, the ultimate goal is some sort of \\npeaceful resolution to the conflict in Bosnia.  As you know, the \\nadministration is considering a wide variety of options at this \\npoint.  The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of \\nEastern Bosnia is quite serious.  And the President will meet with \\nhis Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that a question they're going to try to be \\ndeciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, they'll be reviewing a number of \\noptions, including the peace plan.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does the group that he's meeting with today include \\nReg Bartholomew?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's here.  But it will be \\namong the usual -- Secretary Christopher, Secretary Aspin, General \\nPowell.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, do you have anything on the apparent \\nencounter by U.S. F-15s over Bosnia today -- some aircraft violating \\nthe no-fly zone?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I don't.  I'll get back to you on that.\\n\\x0c\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will the President be meeting with every one of the \\nleaders coming to town for the Holocaust Museum?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He will.  He'll be meeting, as you know, \\nwith Vaclav Havel today and with Lech Walesa tomorrow, and then with \\nthe rest of the group tomorrow afternoon.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  As a group, or one by one?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it's as a group.  Now, Havel and \\nWalesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for \\nquite some time.  But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of \\nstate that are here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, has the President decided whether he \\nsupports the gay and lesbian civil rights act?  And has anything been \\nworked out for him to address the march on Sunday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think he'll probably have a letter or some \\nkind of a statement to the march.  We haven't worked out the exact \\ndetails of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Not a live phone hook-up?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Probably not, given the logistics of getting \\nto Boston.  The speech, as you know, is at 4:00 p.m.  The answer to \\nthe other part of your question is, no, he hasn't taken a position on \\nit.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said that speech in Boston was at 4:00 p.m.?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe so, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know what it's on?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll still working out --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  General Vessey's coming back tonight from Vietnam.  \\nWhen will he be meeting with the President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No specific meeting is scheduled.  We'll \\ntalk to him at some point and see.  We look forward to his report, \\nbut exactly how he'll make that report is unclear.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So he's not going to come immediately to the White \\nHouse?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The AIDS czar -- how close are you?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Still working on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Drug czar?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you expect it before the march?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't have a time line on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the \\nLloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He's just not going to.\\n\\x0c\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are Senate Democrats here at this hour?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, that's tomorrow -- tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Update on the stimulus, possible scaling down --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the Senate will vote on \\namendments today.  We'll continue to talk.  The President is \\ncommitted to some kind of a jobs package; we'd like to see it passed.  \\nAnd we'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where \\nwe end up.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When this briefing is over can you give us word \\nthrough the speaker or whatever whether the President's talked to \\nJanet Reno?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll be happy to.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It's become a pressing question for the last \\nseveral hours.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, just this minute that I've been here, \\nand I haven't had a chance to follow up on it, Helen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he have an opinion on Hatfield?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I mean, obviously, he prefers -- he offered \\na compromise package of $12.2 billion.  He believes that that's the \\nbest alternative, believes that he's obviously willing to take a \\nsecond look at the package.  And I think the Senate will vote on that \\ntoday, and we're hopeful that the President's bill, which will be the \\nMitchell amendment, will be the one that will be approved.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, is there any White House official that \\nwill be at the march on Sunday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Somebody will be there representing the \\nPresident.  I don't know who yet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, has it been decided how he's going to \\naddress?  Is it going to be a videotape or a phone call?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think it will probably be a letter, but \\nthere hasn't been a final decision on that yet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The official will read the letter, is that what it \\nsounds like?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Lloyd Bentsen came in here this morning.  Do you \\nknow what was that about?  Was that about this Waco thing?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, actually it wasn't.  It may have come \\nup, but it was about economic issues.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On health care -- is the 17th of May still the \\ntarget?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  That's still the target.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And there's talk about a Joint Session of Congress \\nspeech at the end of May --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We haven't resolved exactly how the \\nPresident will present the health care plan to the people.  I \\nwouldn't rule that out as an option, but no decisions have been made.\",\n",

The game plan was to rush the net and \\ntry and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky\\nKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames\\nconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren\\nFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren\\nRychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. \\n\\nGoaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the\\nloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got\\nvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and \\nsweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off\\nChris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 2:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the\\npotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.\\nThe first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary\\ncame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring\\nfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. \\n\\nThe deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary\\ndominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better\\nuse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary\\nalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up\\na shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the\\ngame with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when\\nthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. \\n\\nThe Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he\\nwas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie\\nHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. \\n\\nThe game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of\\nCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for\\ninstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato\\ndrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed\\n30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct\\nfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a\\nfight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and\\nYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil \\nturtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at \\neach other was just roughing?

While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques\\nDemers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively,\\nembarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the \\nplayoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the\\nNorris).\\n\\nIt\\'s true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before \\nQuinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*--\\ntougher division than the Norris, also known as the \"Snorris\", division.\\nVancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley\\nCup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such \\npowerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force\\nin the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while\\nover this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was \\neverybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just\\nto keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a\\nlot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.\\n\\nBryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good\\nplayers, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (And\\nno doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The\\nrest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason\\nthey got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the\\ncoaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort\\npossible out of his team.  Then, even his coaching began to degrade.\\n\\n\\nThere are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn\\'t in as bad a shape standings\\nwise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which\\nI outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with\\nat the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player\\ncannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I\\'m sure everyone\\nreading this will agree.  \\n\\nWe\\'ll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they\\nface each other in the conference final (assuming they don\\'t get knocked out,\\nlike last year).\\n',\n",

The ones who regard the playoff\\n\"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\\ngoing to come back with \"winning spirit\" and all of that crap but these\\nplayers are professionals after all.

EDT\\n\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Please be seated.  I \\nwant to say, first, how delighted I am to be here with Secretary \\nRiley and with Senator Graham.  The three of us served as governors \\ntogether during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to \\nimprove our schools, when we led often difficult and long efforts to \\nupgrade the standards in American education and to improve the \\nquality of instruction our children were receiving.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There were no two governors whom I admired more during \\nthat period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher \\nof the Year.  And I think both of them would join me in saying that, \\nafter all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been \\npassed and the funds have been raised and allocated, it all comes \\ndown to what happens between the teacher and the students in the \\nclassroom.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     That's why today's ceremony honoring the National \\nTeacher of the Year is so important.  Tracey Leon Bailey is one \\nrecognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative \\nscience programs.  He's developed and introduced into Florida's \\nclassrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and DNA \\nfingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and, I \\nmight add, probably only dimly understood here in the Nation's \\nCapital.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Within three years of being hired by a satellite high \\nschool, Mr. Bailey's institution had one of the strongest science \\nprograms in the entire state of Florida, and it won numerous national \\nand international awards.  These advanced programs aren't just for a \\nfavored few.  Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students, \\nincluding those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach \\nfor excellence and to attain it.  This is what our students need and \\nwhat our country needs. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Today, we know that a good future with high wages and \\nrich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a \\nlifetime.  The basics aren't enough anymore.  All our kids need \\ncompetence in math and science and advanced problem-solving.  That's \\nwhy Tracey Bailey's accomplishments are so important and why I am so \\npleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these \\naccomplishments. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Tracey, you represent the best in the United States.  \\nI'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this \\nApple Award as the Teacher of the Year for 1993.  (Applause.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. BAILEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It is indeed a \\ngreat honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's \\n2.5 million teachers.  And we appreciate the support that you have \\nshown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to \\nhelp redesign and improve our nation's schools.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We know that the quality of our children's education \\nwill directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape \\nin the years to come.  And we thank you so much for your continued \\nsupport and commitment to our children's education.  Thank you again.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  In closing, I would like to also welcome \\nthe education leaders in Florida who are here, those representing the \\nnational education groups who have also come.  I'd like to recognize \\nTracey's congressman, Representative Jim Bacchus in the back, himself \\na great advocate of education.  And I'd like to remind all of you \\nthat the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award \\nis to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to \\npeople all across this country who give their lives to our children, \\nall of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their \\nbest to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of \\nAmerica.  They are, in so many ways, our most important public \\nservants.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\",\n",

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \\n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \\n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\\n in the dressing room.\\n\\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\\n\\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\\n well.

However, this does not refute debunking\\nof waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the\\nU.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis\\nE. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.\\n\\nDoug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada\\'s\\nhealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one\\nsmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.\\n\\n\\nOf course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany\\ncase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public\\nsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra\\ninsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward\\naccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal\\nbenefits, they\\'ll have nothing to do with you if you want to be\\ncovered for basic care.\\n\\nAt that point, they wouldn\\'t even consider a \"voucher\" approach\\nto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up\\nthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.\\n\\n\\nIt is \"free\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two\\nthings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like\\nreal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when\\nworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying\\nfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my\\npay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only\\nannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal\\nnaifs will proclaim that it\\'s free, along with the Canadian Left for\\nthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.\\n\\nThe French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine\\'s Summer \\n1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance\\ncoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For \\n1-30 days, you\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%\\nafterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private\\nhospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital\\nrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same\\ncash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid\\nout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.\\nOver 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,\\nthe other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not\\ngleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and\\nprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that\\nyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.\\n\\n\\nHealth insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its\\njust that it doesn\\'t cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada\\nand Germany, but you\\'ll have to go uninsured as a result because\\nthere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.\\n\\nWhen private insurance realized how much money they\\'d make without the\\nrisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe\\namenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on\\nthe fritz in someone\\'s private hospital room), they started to pat\\nthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.

              "  '\\n\\n       This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada\\'s\\nviolent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S.  (Our\\nnon-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate).  It\\nwould seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun\\ncontrol laws.\\n\\n       I think if we looked we\\'d find very specific (cultural and\\nenforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then\\nthat reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.\\n\\n\\n       Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished\\nbecause somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a\\ncrime with it a silly solution, it still doesn\\'t address the\\nquestion of Canada.  (Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising\\ngun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to \"magically\"\\nkeep the guns out, but now isn\\'t.)\\n\\n\\n       The other side of the coin, of course, is that far \"illegal drugs\"\\nare purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally. \\nI\\'ve still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals\\nhave shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources\\n(stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn\\'t simply\\nsee South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as\\nwell, since there\\'s a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.\\n\\n\\n        And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques\\nof it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come\\nto mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost\\nentirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed\\nfor poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you\\ncompared the white majority they were virutally identical.\\n\\n        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.\\nnon-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative\\nconditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of\\nnomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into\\naccount that the non-whites in either city were not living in the\\nsame conditions.\\n\\n        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,\\nthen we\\'d expect that the white rates, the two groups which are\\narguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far\\nhigher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only\\nnot significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly\\nlower.\\n\\n\\n\\n       The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. \"inner-city\"\\nproblems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition\\nwhich is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent\\ncrime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control\\nis the source of Canada\\'s low rate is highly questionable.  (As one\\nCanadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada\\'s major gun control\\nin 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase\\nin violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently\\nthey didn\\'t even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in\\nthe early eighties.\\n\\n\\n       True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where\\ngun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that\\ncrime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.\\n\\n       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high\\nor low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact\\nviolent crime.

Alexander Mogilny led the\\ncomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at\\n3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots\\non goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and\\nLaFontaine all night.\\n\\nRoster move:\\n\\nAndre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy\\nscratch.\\n\\nLines:\\n\\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\\nBeranek-Brind\\'Amour-Dineen\\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\\nFaust-Acton-Brown\\n\\nGalley-Bowen\\nYushkevich-Hawgood\\nCarkner-McGill\\n\\nTommy Soderstrom\\n\\nGame Summary:\\n\\nSay, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that\\nwoman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!\\n\\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\\nfirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that\\nhe was getting bored back there...\\n\\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After\\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\\nto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\\n\\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\\n\\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\\ndidn\\'t allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn\\'t get anything going and the\\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\\n\\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\\nRuss Farwell\\'s trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they\\'d do\\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\\nnext year he said that it\\'s Russ\\' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\\nend of the season. He feels that they\\'re 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\\n\\nHe\\'s very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with\\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\\nfour years if there was a consensus.\\n\\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn\\'t know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\\n\\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\\nall over it.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln\\'t\\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind\\'Amour hustled ahead to\\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\\n\\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn\\'t even swing his\\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\\n\\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\\nset up quickly, but couldn\\'t get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\\n\\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\\nangles...\\n\\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\\n\\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\\n\\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\\n\\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,\\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\\n\\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom\\'s 5 hole for his 76th at\\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\\n\\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\\nthe middle. While Brind\\'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek\\'s glove side at 6:44.\\n\\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind\\'Amour and Ledyard went\\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\\nof the season.\\n\\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\\n\\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren\\'t able to pull Hasek as time was running \\nout as the FLYERS wouldn\\'t allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\\ncorner and Brind\\'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\\ngame.\\n\\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn\\'t been tested much\\nin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don\\'t think so).\\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\\nwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\\n\\nA couple misc notes:\\n\\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\\n\\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\\n\\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom\\'s medical record and determined that no\\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\\n\\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\\nexpected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,\\nhe feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a\\nrole scouting if Farwell didn\\'t want him back.\\n\\nFLYERS team record watch:\\n\\nEric Lindros:\\n\\n41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points\\n\\n(rookie records)\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nEric Lindros\\t40 1992-93\\t\\tDave Poulin\\t76 1983-84\\nBrian Propp\\t34 1979-80\\t\\tBrian Propp\\t75 1979-80\\nRon Flockhart\\t33 1981-82\\t\\tEric Lindros\\t74 1992-93\\nDave Poulin\\t31 1983-84\\t\\tRon Flockhart\\t72 1981-82\\nBill Barber\\t30 1972-73\\t\\tPelle Eklund\\t66 1985-86\\n\\nMark Recchi:\\n\\n52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points.\\n\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nReggie Leach\\t61 1975-76\\t\\tMark Recchi\\t121 1992-93*\\nTim Kerr\\t58 1985-86,86-87\\tBobby Clarke\\t119 1975-76\\nTim Kerr\\t54 1983-84,84-85\\tBobby Clarke\\t116 1974-75\\nMark Recchi\\t52 1992-93\\t\\tBill Barber\\t112 1975-76\\nRick Macliesh\\t50 1972-73\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t104 1972-73\\nBill Barber\\t50 1975-76\\t\\tRick Macliesh\\t100 1972-73\\nReggie Leach\\t50 1979-80\\n\\n*More than 80 games.\\n\\nFLYERS career years:\\n\\nPlayer\\t\\tPoints\\tBest Prior Season\\nMark Recchi\\t121\\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\\nRod Brind\\'Amour\\t84\\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\\nGarry Galley\\t62\\t38 (84-85 Kings)\\nBrent Fedyk\\t59\\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\\n\\nThat\\'s all for now...',\n",

It would not have lasted because\\n#  the growth in the North would not have been sustained for much longer without\\n#  spilling over to the Southern states, i.e. Northern industry would have \\n#  migrated capital to the Southern states, and with that would have come \\n#  immigrant labor to the ports of the South, e.g. Charleston, Savannah, Mobile,\\n#  New Orleans, etc. This would have put the breaks on the slave market and\\n#  slavery would have been out-moded by the capital intensity of competing \\n#  agriculturalists.

Simple capital to labor ratio...read Michael Parkin _Microeconomics_\\n#  2nd edition, and any other basic economics book.\\n\\nThis assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments\\nwould not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the\\nNorth.  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else\\nto destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt\\nthat they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive\\nthreat.  Thomas Sowell\\'s _Market and Minorities_ argues that the\\nmaintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local\\ngovernments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside\\ncapital investment in the Southern states.\\n\\n# \\tCraig A.

To help prove my assertions\\nI\\'ve also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly\\ndemonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the\\nrise.  If WOD is working, as we\\'re led to believe, then drug\\nabuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The reality\\nis, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything,\\nsubstance abuse is on the rise.  I\\'m also going to supply a\\npossible solution to this problem.\\n\\nThe following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music\\nand pot entitled \"Hello Again, Mary Jane\" which appears in the\\ncurrent issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).\\n\\n    Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing\\n    smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  \"Perhaps\\n    because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby\\n    is out in full force,\" says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug\\n    Enforcement Administration.  \"The fact is, they\\'re losing the\\n    battle.\"  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said\\n    they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner\\n    says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that\\n    studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of\\n    nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.\\n\\nThe chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993\\nissue of USA Today (\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders\" by Mike\\nSnider, p. 6D).\\n\\n    Adolescents\\' choices\\n\\n    Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:\\n                      Estimated, per 100 students\\n                             1991     1992   Pct. chg.\\n    Alcohol                  25.1     26.1        +4%\\n    Cigarettes               14.3     15.5        +8%\\n    Marijuana                 3.2      3.7       +16% \\n    Amphetamines              2.6      3.3       +27%\\n    LSD                       0.6      0.9       +50%\\n    Cocaine                   0.5      0.7       +40%\\n    Crack                     0.3      0.5       +67%\\n\\n    Source:  University of Michigan Institute for Social Research,\\n    1993 report\\n\\nWe are not winning the \"war on drugs\".  I think you can see that one\\nof the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that\\nthe \"war on drugs\" is being won is to selectively quote statistics---\\nonly statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone\\ndown.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is\\nan excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to\\ndeceive the public.\\n\\nUsage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same\\ntime usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution).\\nAlso, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down\\nbut drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore,\\nif one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all*\\nthe statistics, then it\\'s obvious that the so-called \"war on drugs\" is\\nbeing lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs\\ngo, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants,\\nthen the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed\\nin its true perspective.\\n\\nFor those of you who don\\'t consider alcohol to be a drug then try\\ndrinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me\\nthat it\\'s not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal*\\ndrugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless\\nattempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to\\nanother drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.\\n\\nThe solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to\\nlegalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be\\nwithin reasonable limits (you won\\'t drop dead after using it a few\\ntimes) and then couple this with a massive drug education program.\\nThe reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is\\nbecause people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the\\ngovernment\\'s efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug\\ninterdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug\\neducation).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because\\nthe profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often\\ngoes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that\\naddicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their\\nmoney and posessions in order to support their expensive habit;\\nlegalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall\\nsubstantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.\\n\\nIMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been\\ndone to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to\\nemploy heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating\\nthem.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than\\nthey used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought\\nabout by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can\\nlight up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in\\norder to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods\\nbe used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried\\nout.  They are as follows:\\n\\n    * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which\\n      states the possible health hazzards involved with using this\\n      product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.\\n      Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used\\n      ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.\\n\\n    * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of\\n      revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs\\n      through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from\\n      drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law\\n      enforcement.\\n\\n    * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of\\n      18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the\\n      taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.\\n      Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning\\n      information should also be a felony.\\n\\n    * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the\\n      purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This\\n      agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad\\n      drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.\\n\\nI\\'m sure that many of the things I\\'ve discussed in this article have\\nbeen hashed out before in this newsgroup.

Ville Siren\\'s slap\\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \\n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn\\'t see the puck since\\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \\n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer\\'s goal\\'s far side.\\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\\n game\\'s final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\\n\\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn\\'t the best.\\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\\n to try no combinations.\\n\\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\\n Stillman good on defense.\\n Some players aren\\'t good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\\n\\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn\\'t have a very good game, we\\'ve seen him\\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland\\'s starting goalie in the WC.\\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team.

EDT\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It\\'s\\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\\na national championship.  And we\\'re glad to have them here.\\n\\n     I\\'m inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\\ncheer them onto victory.\\n\\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\\nback in 1978.  I\\'m sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\\n\\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\\npopular sport than hockey.  We don\\'t have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It\\'s a hard-hitting sport.  It does\\nhave one virtue though, there\\'s a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\\n\\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can\\'t imagine.  (Laughter.)  I\\'m\\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\\nthan me.\\n\\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\\nknow a little bit about.\\n\\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\\nbehind.\\n\\n     I think it\\'s important, as I ask young people from\\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\\nof our lives.\\n\\n     We now have another role model, and I\\'m glad to have\\nthem here today.

I think the Attorney\\nGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions\\nto her and to the FBI.\\n\\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\\nshould be executed?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\\n\\n     Q  Is this a raid?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\\ndecisions.\\n\\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\\nmorning?\\n\\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\\n\\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\\nMitchell, he\\'s worth a quarter any day.\\n\\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we\\'re going to\\nhave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to\\ntalk.  And we agreed we\\'d get back together later, around noon, and\\ntalk some more.\\n\\n     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your\\ncompromise is no compromise.\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator\\nDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for\\nthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research\\nindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28\\nemergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan\\nand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those\\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\\nback to work.  I don\\'t want to go back and revisit every one, but you\\n\\n\\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\\nthey\\'re taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\\nto be paid for don\\'t have much of a history on which to base their\\nposition.  They\\'ve got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\\nwork.  So I think we\\'ve got a chance to work it out, and I\\'m hopeful.\\nWe\\'ll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I\\'m feeling pretty good\\nabout it.\\n\\n     THE PRESS:  Thank you\\n\\n                                 END       10:10 A.M. EDT\\n\\n -30-\\n',\n",

              "  'The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993\\nissue of USA Today (\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. eighth-graders\" by Mike\\nSnider, p. 6D).\\n\\n    A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are\\n    using them and fewer deem drug use as risky. \\n\\n    For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results\\n    from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is\\n    being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by\\n    eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students\\n    nationwide.\\n\\n    Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If\\n    drug use dropped during the \\'80s, eventually some students will\\n    have fewer \"drug-using contemporaries\" who act as examples of\\n    substance abuse\\'s drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,\\n    one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths \"must be given\\n    the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,\"\\n    Johnston says.\\n\\n    This type of resurgence \"is possible,\" says Eileen Shiff, author of\\n    \"Experts Advise Parents\" (Delta, $14.95).  But that\\'s not the issue,\\n    she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today\\n    could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.\\n\\n    Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with\\n    drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to\\n    their children.  \"I\\'ve even seen parents serving kegs of beer\" to\\n    their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,\\n    Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, \"lock-in\" party where\\n    no booze or drugs were allowed.  \"We need to fulfill that parental\\n    role, otherwise the peer group takes over,\" she says.\\n\\n    Officials may \"talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven\\'t\\n    done anything that I\\'ve seen,\" says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,\\n    Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and\\n    other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a\\n    member of USA Today\\'s Teen Panel, says \"there\\'s always going to be\\n    experimentation\" with drugs.\\n\\n    A real war on drugs could be waged \"education-wise,\" she says.  But\\n    \"some don\\'t want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give\\n    them ideas; it\\'s the same with birth control.  I think you should\\n    give the kids the information or have it accessible\" through classes,\\n    pamphlets and speakers, she says.\\n\\n    Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in\\n    kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,\\n    Fla.  \"I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think\\n    kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds\\n    (about using drugs),\" he says.\\n\\n    Scare tactics in public service announcements aren\\'t working; only\\n    one commercial has gotten it right, he says.  The commercial opens\\n    with two \"good-looking girls\" in the restroom talking about having\\n    no prom date.  Then they take a hit off a joint.  \"That hits home\\n    because it\\'s not attractive,\" he says.  \"You can\\'t be doing drugs if\\n    you want somebody to like you.\"\\n\\n\\n    Adolescents\\' choices\\n\\n    Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:\\n                      Estimated, per 100 students\\n                             1991     1992   Pct. chg.\\n    Alcohol                  25.1     26.1        +4%\\n    Cigarettes               14.3     15.5        +8%\\n    Marijuana                 3.2      3.7       +16% \\n    Amphetamines              2.6      3.3       +27%\\n    LSD                       0.6      0.9       +50%\\n    Cocaine                   0.5      0.7       +40%\\n    Crack                     0.3      0.5       +67%\\n\\n    Source:  University of Michigan Institute for Social Research,\\n    1993 report\\n\\n\\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot',\n",

              "  '# Recent studies have shown that the number of men who have\\n# engaged in homosexual activities in the last decade is 2.3%\\n# and the number of men who are exclusively homosexual is 1.1%.\\n# These figures are much less than those that came from earlier\\n# studies that showed that homosexuality among men is a lot\\n# higher.\\n# \\n# So, what can we deduce from these figures?  Are there a lot\\n# less male homosexuals than there used to be or are men\\n# (perhaps women too) not as honest as they used to be about\\n# there sexuality?  Presumably, the people that were polled in\\n\\nYou mean, in the 1940s, men and women were much more open about\\ntheir homosexuality than today?  Want to try that one again?\\n\\n# this survey were assured of their anonymnity so they should\\n# have answered the questions honestly I suppose.  However, it\\n# could be that gays feel so repressed and denigrated by society\\n# that they didn\\'t feel that they could be forthcoming about there\\n# sexuality in something like a survey.  If this true then is it\\n# possible that there is a lot more gays out there than we are led\\n# to believe?\\n# \\n# Perhaps if Americans were more open about there sexuality---I think\\n# most Americans aren\\'t---then we might discover that there are really\\n# quite a few more people out there who are orientated toward the same\\n# sex---men and women included.  I\\'d venture a guess that there is a\\n# lot of people out there who have considered having a relationship\\n# with someone of the same sex at some point in there life.  Maybe they\\n# didn\\'t take their longings seriously, but this doesn\\'t make these\\n# longings any less valid.  Therefore, if Americans weren\\'t so\\n# repressed about their sexuality in general---as I believe they may be\\n# ---then we\\'d see a lot more people \"coming out of the closet\".\\n\\nYou mean, ignore study after study, so that we can continue to \\naccept a study (Kinsey\\'s) that is obviously wrong?  \\n\\n# As for myself, I\\'m a heterosexual and I\\'ve never considered having\\n# sex with another man.  That\\'s just the way I am...I could have just\\n# as easily of been gay I suppose.  One of the big debates about\\n# homosexuality is whether or not it\\'s a type of behavior that is\\n# learned or if one is just born that way.  IMHO, the more likely\\n# explanation is that it\\'s some combination of the two.\\n\\nBased on what, besides your own warm fuzzy feelings?\\n\\n# Here\\'s something to ponder upon:  have any of you gay-bashers out\\n# there ever considered that homosexuals probably deem their sexual\\n# orientation as being a state of affairs that is just as much an\\n# intrinsic and \"natural\" part of their life as heterosexuals do\\n# about their own sexuality?  In other words, someone who is *truly*\\n\\nAlcoholics share that feeling, until they hit bottom.\\n\\n# gay may not be able to live any other way.  Even if they date someone\\n# of the opposite sex or get married, in their *heart* they are still a\\n# homosexual.  Likewise, if someone who is *truly* heterosexual forms\\n# a relationship with someone of the same sex, then they are *still*\\n# a heterosexual even though outward appearances may suggest otherwise.\\n# \\n# Scott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot\\n\\nUnless, of course, the problem is that homosexuality is a form\\nof mental disorder, caused by childhood sexual abuse, as a number of\\nrecent works suggest.\\n\\nIf homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their\\nmorality on others (antidiscrimination laws) and leave our children\\nalone, I wouldn\\'t care in the least what they did in private.  But\\nuntil they get over the liberal notion that the proper role of \\ngovernment is to tell peaceful people how to live, I have no choice\\nbut to continue to point out that homosexuality is not an \"alternative\\nlifestyle,\" but a sickness.\\n\\n# Before:  \"David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets\\n#           the Bible through the barrel of a gun...\"  --ATF spokesman\\n# After:   \"[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets\\n#           [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun...\"  --Me\\n\\n\\nGood signature!\\n',\n",

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you \\nin the thousands of communities around the country that are taking \\npart in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas \\nJefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \\nmention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \\nhas been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \\nfollowed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \\nhere in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \\nto Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \\nsystem.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \\nimportance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \\nhere this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \\nPresident Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \\nthe Chamber of Commerce studios.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \\ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \\nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \\nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \\nalso.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \\nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \\nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \\nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \\nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \\nat this time.  It's great to have you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \\nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \\nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \\nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \\ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \\nfrom school to the work place.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \\nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \\neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \\nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \\nmake things happen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \\nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \\nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \\nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \\nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \\nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \\nthe rest of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \\nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \\nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \\nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \\neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \\nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \\nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \\nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \\ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \\nwith changing times.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \\nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \\ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \\nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \\ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \\nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \\nlong run.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \\nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \\nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \\nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \\nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \\nlearn.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \\nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \\nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \\nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \\ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \\nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \\nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \\ncan be learning and working at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \\nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \\ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \\ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \\ncan prepare students for this world of work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \\nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \\nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \\nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \\nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \\njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \\nareas of the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \\nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \\nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \\nwords is that so important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \\nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \\nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \\nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \\ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \\nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \\nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \\nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \\nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \\ntaught before.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \\nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \\nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \\nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \\nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \\ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \\nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \\ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \\ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \\nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \\neducational component of training.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \\nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \\nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \\neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \\nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \\ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \\nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \\napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \\nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \\neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \\nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \\nyoung people even beyond the summer.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \\nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \\nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \\ndeveloping.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \\nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \\nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \\nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \\nget in a high school diploma.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \\nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \\neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \\npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \\ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \\nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \\nemployers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \\ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \\nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \\ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \\nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \\nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \\nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \\nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \\na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \\nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \\nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \\nthe earnings of American workers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \\nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \\npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \\neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \\nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \\nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \\npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \\ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \\nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \\nalready out there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \\nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \\ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \\nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \\nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \\nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \\nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \\ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \\ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \\nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \\nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \\naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \\nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \\nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \\ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \\none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \\nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \\ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \\nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \\nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \\nstrategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \\nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \\nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \\ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \\nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \\neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \\ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \\ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \\nskills for on-the-job learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \\nalready being done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \\npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \\ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \\nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \\nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \\nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \\ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \\nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \\ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \\nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \\nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \\nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \\nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \\ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \\ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \\nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \\nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \\nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \\ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \\ncoming forth before too long.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \\nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \\nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \\na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \\nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \\nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \\ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \\nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \\ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \\nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \\ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \\nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \\ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \\nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \\nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \\ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \\nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \\nlife-long learning in this country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \\nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \\nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \\nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \\nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \\nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \\nthat we need to meet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \\nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \\nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \\nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \\npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \\nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \\nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \\nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \\nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \\nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \\ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \\nI wonder if you would comment on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \\nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \\ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \\nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \\nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \\nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \\nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \\nfor jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \\ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \\ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \\ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \\nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \\ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \\nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \\nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \\nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \\ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \\nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \\nTodd of Austin, Texas.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \\nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \\nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \\nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \\nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \\nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \\nvery supportive.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \\nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \\nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \\nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \\nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \\nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \\nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \\nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \\nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \\nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \\nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \\nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \\nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \\nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \\nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \\nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \\nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \\nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \\ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \\nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \\nworking on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \\nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \\nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \\ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \\nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \\nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \\nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \\ntrained on a year-round basis.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \\na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \\nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \\nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \\nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \\nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \\nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \\ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \\nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \\nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \\nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \\nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \\nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \\naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \\njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \\nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \\neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \\nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \\nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \\nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \\ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \\nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \\nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \\nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \\nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \\nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \\ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \\nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \\nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \\nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \\nmoving.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Doctor?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \\nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \\nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \\nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \\nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \\nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \\nextremely effective learning strategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \\nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \\nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \\npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \\nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \\nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \\nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \\ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \\nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \\ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \\ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \\nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \\nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \\nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \\nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \\nthem and we can discuss it later.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \\nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \\nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \\npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \\nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \\nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \\nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \\nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \\nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \\nvocational program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \\nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \\nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \\nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \\nstudents that needs them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \\nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \\nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \\n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \\nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \\nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \\ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \\ncareer directions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \\ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \\ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \\nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \\nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \\nyour ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \",\n",

EDT\\n             \\n             \\n             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to\\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\\nbroadcast with the American people. \\n             \\n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\\nyear's campaign.\\n             \\n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\\n             \\n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\\nbusiness.  \\n             \\n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\\nfalling behind.\\n             \\n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\\ncost of health care.\\n             \\n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\\nplaces to live.\\n             \\n             In many critical products today Americans are the\\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\\n             \\n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\\n             \\n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \\nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\\n             \\n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \\nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \\n             \\n             I know the American people are tired of business as\\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \\n             \\n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\\nportion of our original goals.\\n             \\n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\\ncreating jobs.\\n             \\n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\\npercent.\\n             \\n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\\nand deserve it.\\n             \\n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\\nCongress this year.\\n             \\n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\\nAmerican people to work.  \\n             \\n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\\nare -- on people or on politics.  \\n             \\n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\\n             \\n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\\nfor over the life of our budget.\\n             \\n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\\n             \\n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.\",\n",

If I were Bill Clement I would\\nshoot myself.\\n\\nAnyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to show\\novertime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was going\\nto happen, in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even\\nthe boring Devils game.\\n\\nOverall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmly\\nbelive that they have know respect for the fans. ie *because of contract       \\nobligations*, screw you ESPN.\\n\\nPraise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit!\\n\\nGO HAWKS!!!\",\n",

His charts and graphs, based on detailed histories of 12,000\\nmen and women, demonstrated that practices generally considered rare\\nand/or \\'abnormal\\'-- masturbation, extramarital relations,\\nhomosexuality, and even barnyard bestiality, were as American as\\nstrawberry shortcake.  \\n\\n     Yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists, aided and\\nabetted by Pat Buchanan and the religious right, the zoology professor\\nfrom Indiana University remains the evil genius behind the sex\\nrevolution and a target for character assassination.  \\n\\n     Judith Reisman, the prosecution\\'s expert witness at the\\nMapplethorpe trial in Cincinnati, is the leader of the anti- Kinsey\\nrevisionists as well as his Inspector Javert.  In 1983, during a radio\\ninterview with Pat Buchanan in Washington, Reisman accused Kinsey of\\nhaving been inolved in \"the vicious genital torture of hundreds of\\nchildren.\"  She speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in\\norder to carry out clandestine orgasm tests.  \\n\\n     Now, seven years later, Reisman has revived her charges in a\\ndifferent book, titled Kinsey, Sex and Fraud, just released by the\\nsmall and religiously oriented Huntington House in Lafayette,\\nLouisiana.  Her coauthor is Ed Eichel, a Manhattan psychotherapist who\\nhas invented a new style of intromission (\"the coital alignment\\ntechnique\") that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with\\nconsiderable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the\\nsexes.  In the book Eichel contends that \"Kinsey deliberately cooked\\nthe gay stats because, being an oddball himself, he wanted to advance\\nthe \\'denormalization\\' of heterosexuality.\"  \\n\\n     If the authors are right, then the world- famous Kinsey Reports\\nare, as the introduction boldly asserts, \"the most egregious example\\nof scientific deception in this century.\"  And if they are wrong,\\nKinsey, Sex and Fraud is a shameful smear.\\n\\n     Despite the less- than- stellar credentials of Kinsey\\'s\\ndetractors, legends are not what they used to be.  Martin Luther King\\nmay have committed plagiarism.  Bruno Bettelheim slapped young mental\\npatients around.  Father Bruce Ritter, the founder of Covenant House,\\npreyed on runaway boys.  Closer to Kinsey, Masters and Johnson have\\nbeen disgraced for faking it in one way or another.  \\n\\n     So it should not surprise anybody that Kinsey, who filmed strange\\npeople having sex in his attic, may have had skeletons in the closet.\\nThe problem is that Reisman does not seem to have the intellectual\\nprowess to pull off the job.  \\n\\n     As a thinker, the woman is no Madame Curie.  The 55-year-old\\nformer songwriter for Captain Kangaroo has little professional\\nstanding, no current university position, and no peer-review\\npublications, though her creative 1983 resume was padded with phantom\\naccomplishments.  For instance, it listed a book as her own-- Take Back\\nthe Night: Women on Pornography-- that was actually written and edited\\nby others.  Then there is her Ph.D. in Speech Communication from\\nCleveland\\'s Case Western Reserve University.  Although Reisman has no\\nbachelor\\'s degree, Case granted her a master\\'s in 1976 and a doctorate\\nin 1979.  Her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local\\noctagenarian TV commentator.  But on the resume, Reisman gave this\\npiece of scholarship a fancy Hautes Etudes moniker-- to wit: \"The\\nApplication of Aristotelian and Systems Analytic Theory to Mass Media\\nEffects.\"\\n\\n     When Reisman burst into prominence on Buchanan\\'s program, it was\\nlove at first sight for Al Regnery, the outwardly anti- \\nporn head of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in Ed Meese\\'s\\nJustice Department.  Regnery was a young law-and-order conservative and\\namateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual\\nclimate of the United States.  \\n\\n     After Reisman\\'s sensational radio session, the sexual equivalent\\nof Joe McCarthy\\'s Wheeling speech, Regnery summoned \\nher to meetings to discuss mutual interests.  First he tried to shovel\\nher $800,000 for a quasi-Frankenstein study that was going to measure\\nthe brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing\\nphotographs.  Guffaws on Capitol Hill killed the original proposal, but\\n$734,000 in govemment money went to Reisman anyway for plan B- a probe\\nof child images in the cartoons Playboy, Penthouse, and Hust\\nler.  (Incredibly, this grant surpassed the entire budget of the\\nattorney general\\'s pornography commission.) \\n\\n     When the overpriced and oversold project was completed in 1986,\\nit was immediately shelved by an embarrassed Justice Department.  That\\nspring, Regnery resigned from his post only days before the New\\nRepublic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines\\naround the house.  \\n\\n     Notwithstanding the six-figure humiliation, Reisman went on to\\nscratch out a niche on the ioony right.  As the darling of the sex\\ncranks, she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in\\nmen\\'s magazines and blames AIDS on gays.  Kinsey, Sex and Fraud is\\nReisman\\'s latest grasp for respectability.  Pat Buchanan, of course, is\\nputting his Krugerrands on Reisman\\'s ultimate vindication.  \"This book\\nis social dynamite,\" he says in a blurb an the front cover.  He\\nespecially liked the antigay parts.  Smacking his lips in his\\nsyndicated column, he declared, \"It may just blow the sewer cap off\\nKinsey\\'s monumental reputation, reestablish homosexuality as a 1-in-50\\naberration, expose the Gay Rights movement as a paper tiger, and even\\nput at risk the enormous sex industry built upon Dr. Kinsey\\'s\\n\\'research.\\'\"\\n\\n     The blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and\\nrepetilive j\\'Accuse is that Kinsey was a sex-mad pedophile who\\nmolested little boys in Nazi-type experiments and recorded their\\norgasms in his male volume/ A similar charge was first recited at the\\nFifth World Conference on Sexology in Jerusalem in 1981 to no effect\\nbefore being recycled by Reisman for Buchanan in Washington in 1983.\\n\\n     Here is how Reisman and Eichel repackaged the Mengele business in\\nKinsey, Sex and Fraud:\\n\\n     Mengele-like \\'scientific\\' experiments on infants and children\\nwere the basis for Kinsey\\'s conclusions...  on childhood sexuality.\\n\\n     Somewhere and sometime in the course of the project, Kinsey\\nappears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred\\nchildren aged from two months to almost 15 years.\\n\\n     This, of course, would implicate Kinsey and his team in\\npromoting, and perhaps participating in, the criminal activity.\\n\\n     In the opinion of this book\\'s authors, that is exactly how part\\nof Kinsey\\'s child sexuality research took place.\\n\\n\\n     Donning his psychohistorian\\'s cap and citing an FBI manual on\\nchild molesters as a guide, Eichel casually diagnoses Kinsey as a\\nhomosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as\\n \\n\\n     [Kinsey] placed himself in professional and nonprofessional\\npositions where he had access to young boys, such as Y.M.C.A.  camp\\ncounselor, boys\\' club leader, and Boy Scout leader-- activities he\\nkept up \\'during his college and graduate yeaers, and even after his\\nmarriage.\"\\n \\n\\n     As crude as his analysis seems, Eichel was more than happy to\\nelaborate even further in a recent phone interview.  \"If you\\'ve ever\\nbeen around boy- lovers, pedophiles, they are absolutely compulsive,\"\\nhe averred.  \"Everything in his life is directed at getting children.  I\\ndidn\\'t mention this in our book but the caption under Kinsey\\'s high\\nschool picture was a quote from Hamlet: \\'Man delights me not, no,\\n[sic] nor woman neither.\\' What do you think they were picking up on?\" \\n\\n     Before weighing what Reisman and Eichel pass off as proof of\\nKinsey\\'s sex crimes, something must be said about Kinsey\\'s scientific\\nmodus operandi.  He was a fiendish collector.  As a young zoologist with\\na D.Sc.  from Harvard, he collected 4 million gall wasps and 1.5\\nmillion related insects.  When he switched to sex exploration after\\nagreeing to teach a marriage Course at Indiana University in 1938, he\\nwas no less curious or acquisitive.  Nothing that mammals did in the\\nrealm of reproduction was foreign to him.  He compiled masses of erotic\\nmaterials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female\\njohns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of\\nmating in 14 species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in\\noral eroticism.  \\n\\n     Naturally, the sexual response of children, the genesis of eros,\\nfascinated him.  It was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors\\nof adults without examining their origins.  And so with the fervor of\\nhis bughunting days, Kinsey collected information about kids, though\\neven his worst enemies-- until Reisman and Eichel-- refrained from\\nlinking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex.  \\n\\n     Kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on\\nthe sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them: \"Some of\\nthese adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or\\nother records which have been put at our disposal.\"  Although he\\ngathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the\\nobservations of parents and nursery school teachers, he treated the\\ndocumentary materia! of the pedophiles as pure gold.  There was nothing\\nlike it in the literature.  \\n\\n     Kinsey\\'s main source, a 63-year-old govemment worker, was also\\nthe most unforgettable character he had ever met.  This man, whose\\nhistory took 17 hours to log, had sex with over 600 boys and 200 girls\\nas well as 17 of 33 family members including his father and\\ngrandmother.  A sexual hobbyist and passionate record-keeper, he gave\\nKinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent\\nboys.  Relying on the man\\'s meticulous research, which involved\\nfollowing some boys for as long as 16 years, Kinsey was able to\\nidentify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm-- some\\nof which involved violent contortions at the peak of release-- as well\\nas the speed and the capacity of climax.  \\n\\n     What Freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality, Kinsey\\nhad reported as fact.  Children were indeed erotic beings from the\\ncradle.  \"These data on the sexual activities of younger male provide\\nan important substantiation of the Freudian view of sexuality as a\\ncomponent that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy,\"\\nhe concluded without raising eyebrows in 1948.  \\n\\n     Then along came Judith Reisman.  Ignorng the legitimacy of\\nKinsey\\'s inquiry, she beheld the ghost of Mengele in Bloomington.  She\\nwas appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the\\nportrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker.\\nAnd she dared to say that Kinsey was a sex criminal.  \\n\\n     Well, was he or wasn\\'t he? Let\\'s go to the text.  There is no\\nevidence in Kinsey, Sex and Fraud-- no witnesses, no paper, noteven a\\ntrace of hearsay-- that implicates Kinsey in either planning or\\npartaking in child sex experiments.  After 12 years on the trail,\\nReisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge-\\n- amazingly enough, Kinsey himself and Wardell Pomeroy, Kinsey\\'s\\ncoauthor on both reports, to whom Reisman has never spoken.  It turns\\nout that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume\\niand in Pomeroy\\'s 1972 biography titled Dr. Kinsey and the Institute\\nfor Sex Research.\\n\\n     After frisking every \"the\" and \"and\" in both books, Reisman came\\nup with what she believes are \"smoking\" sentences.  To establish\\nKinsey\\'s alleged role in the planning, she says that \"there is a hint\"\\nin the fifth chapter of the male volume that Kinsey \"directed\" the\\norgasm studies on kids.  She cites his tell-tale quote from a critic of\\narmchair psychoanalysis demanding that \"writers...test their\\ntheories...by empirical study and statistical procedures.\"  Then she\\ncombines this quote with Kinsey\\'s statement that some of the\\nobservations of his pedophile sources \"were continued over periods of\\nmonths or years until the individuals were old enough to make it\\ncertain that true orgasm was involved.\"  \\n\\n     Putting two and two together-- Kinsey\\'s empiricism and lengthy\\nexperimentation-- she arrives at her hint.  But realizing this dog\\nwould not hunt, she devoted but a single paragraph to Kinsey\\'s\\nsupposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal\\ninvolvement.  As for the alleged participation, after poring over\\nPomeroy\\'s biography, Reisman found several hidden clues suggesting\\nKinsey\\'s likely hands-on approach to kiddie sex.  Here the chain of\\nreasoning is more complex.  She points out that Kinsey was interested\\nin clitoral measurements, collecting sperm and filming sex in his\\nattic.  Since Kinsey did indeed mislead Indiana University about the\\npurpose of his cinematography-- he said that he was filming \"animal\\nsex\"-- Reisman asserts that a \"similar misrepresentation may yet apply\\nto Kinsey\\'s child sex experiments.\"  Catch the \"may\"!\\n\\n     Reisman was also struck by Kinsey\\'s doubting Thomas attitude\\ntoward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits: \"Kinsey,\\naccording to Pomeroy, was the type of person who needed to see things\\nfor himself.  Pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit.\\nBecause he had not personally witnessed this event, Kinsey had\\ndifficulty in accepting its reality, even on the strength of testimony\\nfrom a distinguished scientist.  How then did Kinsey testify to the\\nactuality of orgasm in a 5-month-old infant from the mere \\'history\\' of\\na sex offender?\" (But, of course, he did not: he depended on their\\nrecords.) \\n\\n     From this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides,\\nsperm, attic cumshots, and climax-in-cottontail has Reisman defamed\\nthe legendary Kinsey.\\n\\n     Paul Gebhard succeeded Kinsey as the director of the Kinsey\\nInstitute and now lives in retirement outside Bloomington.  Reached by\\ntelephone, Gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied\\nReisman\\'s nasty imputations.  \"I don\\'t understand the resistance of\\npeople like Reisman to studying the sexuality of children,\" Gebhard\\nsaid more in exasperation than anger.  \"That is where sex begins.  We\\nwere happy to take data wherever we found it.  Even though pedophiles\\ncommit criminal acts, they are usually not violent folks.  They\\nwouldn\\'t be very successful if they were.  One of our best sources was\\na headmaster of a boys\\' school who maintained a kind of alumni club\\nand sometimes went to the weddings of his former students.  As for\\ndirecting experiments, that\\'s absurd.  We never told any of our\\nsubjects what to do.  lt was against our principles.  Almost all of the\\npedophile material was retrospective anyway.  Nor did we ever conduct\\nsex experiments with children ourselves.  That would have been highly\\ninappropriate.\"  \\n\\n     I asked Gebhard if Kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual\\nsituation.  \"I think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped\\nher teddy bear and Kinsey watched it.\"  \\n\\n     As for Kinsey\\'s sex life, it is still shrouded in\\nconfidentiality.  He was married to the same woman for 35 years and\\nfathered four children.  Apparently, there are no huge sexual\\nrevelations, although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without\\nconfirmation through the years.  Gebhard took his boss\\'s history back\\nin the \\'40s, but he refuses to discuss what he knows.  \"We never\\ndivulge anything about anybody\\'s history, whether dead or alive,\" he\\nsays.  \\n\\n     Reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds\\nthat I had once worked for Penthouse-- not to mention the fact that we\\nhave been debating each other in various forums for the past five\\nyears.  In keeping with our contentious history, she took a swipe at me\\nin her book for continuing \"the Kinsey practice of euphemizing\\nincest.\"  My offense was using the biblical variant \"lying with a near\\nrelative\" in a 1977 article on the subject of incest.  As a synonym for\\nintercourse, \"lying with\" appears eight times in Genesis.  \\n\\n     Ed Eichel is a different story.  Though seemingly obsessed by\\nKinsey like his coauthor, he was friendly in long conversations.  He\\ntold me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he\\nwas a student in New York University\\'s Human Sexuality program in the\\nearly \\'80s.  \"It was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals,\"\\nhe says.\\n\\n     Around 1985, Eichel came upon Reisman\\'s critique of Kinsey and\\nthe conspiracy theory started to sink in: the sex establishment was\\nruled by a Kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the\\nheterosexual norm.  No wonder he was having such a rough time promoting\\nthe joy of simultaneous orgasm-- anything that enhanced sexual\\ncompatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections.\\n\\n     Eventually, Eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with Reisman,\\nand from this union Kinsey, Sex and Fraud was born.  Eichel\\'s main\\ncontribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a Kinsey\\nconspiracy that supposedly seeks \"the establishment of bisexuality as\\nthe balanced sexual orientation for normal, uninhibited people\" which,\\nby destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual\\nbehavior, \"would open the way for the second and more difficult step--\\nthe ultimate goal of cross-generational sex (sex with children).\"  \\n\\n     When I pressed him for specific references to back up his\\noutrageous contentions, he said weakly, \"You don\\'t think Kinsey is\\ngoing to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual\\nand should have sex with kids, but this is implicit in the Kinsey\\nreports.\"  \\n\\n     Meanwhile, Eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of\\nKinsey and his data.  Perfect.  That\\'s just what the country needs-- a\\nHouse Un-American Sexual Activities Committee, looking under beds and\\nasking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader, a sympathizer\\nor-- God forbid-- a subject of Dr. Alfred Kinsey.\\n\\n\\n         Elf !!!\\n--\\nelf@halcyon.com  (Elf Sternberg)',\n",

              "  \"\\nNo.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is the\\nreason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that\\ngoaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're\\nMontreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it;\\nhe literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an\\nexcuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst\\ngoals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,\\nStewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.\\n\\nMontreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear\\ntraffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). \\nNormally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than \\nfive, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME \\nESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't\\nthink this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear \\nthe zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to \\nplay.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.\\n\\nDemers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let\\nthe damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this\\narticle, if possible.\\n\\n\\nI didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't\\nthink Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who)\\nin the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in\\nregardless.\\n\\n\\nYep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second,\\nIMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.\\n\\nSpeaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a\\nteam so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their\\nzone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red \\nArmy.  \\n\\nBut I still hate the team.\\n\\nOn the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a\\npowerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. \\nSame goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is\\nwaving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New\\nJersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is\\nunbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I \\nhate that team anyway.\\n\\n\",\n",

              "  '\\nPeter Nelson posted a very eloquent response to this point in \\ntalk.politics.misc, so I need not consume more bandwidth here.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat I meant, if it was not clear, was the intersection set of liberal\\nand libertarian philosophies of \"natural rights\" and how the government\\n(and Constitutional interpretation in particular) fits into that \\nphilosophy.  This philosophy engages in the very serious practical \\nerror of endowing the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court with an almost \\ntotalitarian authority, completely outside of the consent or consensus \\nof The People.  This is why Supreme Court nominations are such amazing\\npolitical fist-fights these days, because He who Controls the Court\\nRules the Country.  The people on the Court may well be trying to do\\nthe best job they can, but they are at best a benevolent oligarch, even\\nif you approve of every Supreme Court decision ever.  Eventually, an\\noligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear.  Try \\nSupreme Court cases by Jury, and the problem would be mitigated a great \\ndeal.\\n\\nThose who would create broad, non-enumerated government powers at any \\nlevel (as in European Parlamentary Democracies and the current de-facto\\nstandard in the U.S.) have essentially engaged in the same fundamental \\nmistake, except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian, \\nvirtually unchecked (except by plurality election, death, or retirement), \\ngovernment power. \\n\\n\\n\\nThis is like asking why the wind blows, unless you can prove that\\nthe fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no \\neffect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented to\\nyour engagement in those activities.  Very few human activities indeed\\nfit into this category.  \\n\\nEven for those few that do, who would you empower to make the judgement \\nof what is and is not a fully autonomous activity?  Who defines \"picking \\nmy pocket\" and \"defrauding\"?  Are economic assets a person\\'s only assets,\\nor are peace of mind, stability, confidence in a child\\'s emotional \\nenvironment, security, and many other things not also a part of a person\\'s\\nassets?  What gives you the right to create a moral environment that a\\nparent strongly objects to?  What gives you the right to create an \\nenvironment of social unrest and instability?  If you say that what you\\ndo does not have those effects, by what authority do you say that?  Who\\nis empowered to make these value judgements?\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the Federal Constitution explicitly prohibited you from doing so, the \\nfederal government would prevent you from doing so.  If it did not, and\\nyou could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local\\nConstitution (by, say, a 3/4 majority) empowering the local government \\nto do so, then I would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood\\nmore friendly to my own system of values.  This is not an ideal situation,\\nbut it is far better than the mess we are mired in right now.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you define \"rights\" very broadly, there is no practical choice about \\nwhether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these\\n\"rights\" overlap.  Even when rights are defined very narrowly, the government \\nhas been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights.  The \\nfundamental question is, by whose authority is that power created.  If you \\nsupport the current situation with a \"natural rights\" Supreme Court (rather\\nthan an \"original understanding\" Supreme Court or, even better, Supreme\\nCourt by Jury), you are consenting to having nine lawyers in Washington, \\nD.C. create those powers out of the air.  In my \"Fractal Federalism\" scenario, \\nit is a broad consensus of The People (i.e. the amendment process) that \\ncreates those powers.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, I mean the federal government that comes trucking in with guns to\\ntell the locals how to run their neighborhood.  Waco, TX is a nice example.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you create a community where public masturbation is permitted in the \\ncause of \"personal autonomy\", have you done anything different?  What\\nprecisely are these autonomous activities you are referring to?  If you\\nlist them, perhaps we can get enough people to agree that they are truly\\nautonomous and pass a constitutional amendment protecting them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Koresh Incident appears to be a horrendous abuse of government power,\\npower possibly illegitimately obtained through a means I would abolish. \\nThe constitutionality of \"no-knock\" warrants seems very dubious to me, not\\nto mention the mere existence of BATF and the government\\'s propensity to \\nignore the word \"infringe\" in the Second Amendment.  This power is upheld \\nby the same body, with its incredible concentration of power in the hands \\nof nine people, that has upheld much so-called \"Civil Rights\" (read- affirmative \\naction) legislation despite the Fourteenth Amendment.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoney is certainly not the only asset I have in this world.

Gary\\nSuter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored\\nby D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made\\nsome bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially\\nimpressive. \\n\\nThe games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and\\nnever recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches,\\nhits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren\\nRychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed\\nto take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think\\nVernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,\\nas Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King\\ninserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's\\ngame. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no\\nidea how serious - he didn't return.\\n\\nI still think the Flames should win this series, but they better\\nbuckle down.\",\n",

As usual, Sahl\\'s was \\nindependent and sharp as a scalpel.\\n\\tMy effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort\\'s. At \\nleast it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I\\'d mention the \\nidea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for \\ndelivery.\\n\\tThose reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the \\nmost peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are \\nnoted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with \\npassion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in \\nfact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost \\nidentical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German \\nelection). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and \\nenthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their \\nideological quilt.\\n\\tThe last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening \\npages of both books. Hitler\\'s example is when, on page 5, he claims the \\nGerman nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway \\nline between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) \\nwas \"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\" when \\nthere has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.\\n\\tIn fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as \\nthe Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost \\nsucceeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic \\nclaim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement \\nceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\" Of \\ncourse, it\\'s not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of \\nGod against an individual\\'s will that\\'s unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is \\ntoo gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.\\n\\tOf course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, \\nmy main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern \\nAmerican Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version \\nof Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), \\nand trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen \\nmillion followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book \\nafter building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in \\nWeimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.\\n\\tThus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh\\'s daily \\nthree-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary \\npropoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way \\nThings Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a \\ntranslation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the \\nprinted word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since \\nradio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of \\nluxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to \\nspend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop \\n$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.\\n\\tBut, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some \\ncloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of \\ntheir propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these \\ndays.)\\n\\tMort might not know exactly who Rush\\'s equivalent of Rodolf \\nHess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of \\nABC radio and now Limbaugh\\'s partner in EFM Media, the radio \\nprogram\\'s production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk \\nshow, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He \\nknows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows \\nthat Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the \\nopportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh \\nearns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it\\'s almost worthy of a \\nRICO indictment.\\n\\tOn questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of \\nmaterial in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler\\'s venom. For \\nexample:\\n\\nOn Their Own Qualifications to Control Society\\n\\tHitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who \\nindividually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly \\nperhaps understand it, one man [author\\'s emphasis] must step forward in \\norder to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of \\nimagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight \\nfor their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of \\nthought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\" \\n(page 577).\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they\\'ve got me? ... The \\nshow is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my \\nbrain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental \\naptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree \\nwith me ... It might take four or five years, but I\\'m convinced The Media \\nwill slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking \\nand screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)\\n\\nOn Religion as the Basis of a Nation\\n\\tHitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are \\ninseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his \\ndecline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without \\nculture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord \\nsins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the \\nexpulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... \\nBut our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or \\nambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a \\ncharming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools \\nfor the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of \\nAmerican education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)\\n\\nOn Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse\\n\\tHitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... \\nOne has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and \\ntheatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... \\nTheatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays \\nmust be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the \\nservice of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that \\nHollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people \\nwho believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality \\nand monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)\\n\\nOn the News Meida\\n\\tHitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of \\ngravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass \\nby in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it\\'s task is only to break the \\npeople\\'s folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of \\nslavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the \\nbandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been \\nreplaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During \\nthe Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global \\nnetwork. We can\\'t take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don\\'t \\nrealize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that \\ntherefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided \\nand, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)\\n\\n*     *     *\\n\\t\\nTo continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but \\nultimately too depressing to take in one reading.\\n\\tAfter putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that \\nhaunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened \\nGermans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed \\nGermans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, \\nRush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to \\ndepressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American \\nradical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the \\nReagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for \\nThe Fascist States of America.\\n\\tAnd if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the \\nradical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only \\nwonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.\\n\\nThe Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-\\n0845; (608) 255-4460.',\n",

              "  '\\nThere are two things at work here ... the public insurance is very\\nwide in what it will cover, as the amortization is also universal.\\nNo private plan can boast of a plan that fits a Gaussian curve ...\\nand as our private sector has discovered, they\\'re better off not\\noffering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use.\\n(-;\\n\\n\\nThe alternative to the system is no system at all (patients opted out,\\ndoctors opted out, or both).  But that only for insurance ... and you\\ncan\\'t force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they\\nwill not offer.

Up north, you\\'re so much more\\nlikely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health\\ninsurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage ...\\n\\n\\nYes, primarily in Quebec and in Alberta.  Sorry, I musta lost you in\\nthat verbose blurb ...\\n\\n\\nIn Canada and Germany, it\\'s not mandatory.  However, it is negative\\noption in that you must request the exemption.  That the private\\nsector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option\\n(as in the Quebec case) tells me something about what they know ...\\n\\n\\nYes, but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are\\ntoo small to sustain many specialists, sometimes not even one, so\\nyou pretty well have to be a GP to get paid.  And if you do get\\nthe training, the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a\\nlicence because there is already someone in the business and who\\ncannot fill his/her appointment book.

We just do\\nnot have enough sick Canadians in absolute numbers otherwise.\\n\\n\\nUh ... Germany basically uses our method, with their many sickness\\nfunds.  The competition is fake if it exists at all, because they\\'re\\nall interlinked.  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is in\\nour German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in\\nSaarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.

Germans have\\npublic health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities\\n(actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who\\'ll sell extra\\ninsurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system,\\nwas one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too).\\n\\nRemember, the Germans don\\'t have HMO\\'s ... a telling sign, \\'cos\\nRochester does and they\\'re also a company town.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll have to let a Canadian MD jump in to verify that claim, but\\nI\\'ve come to learn to suspect anything in the American press about\\nour \"system\".

Simply because a \\nminority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock \\nand hold up action on the President\\'s jobs program is not a sign that \\nhe is not succeeding overall.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He can\\'t beat this, can he?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The fact is they can do that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop \\naction.  There\\'s no question about that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What are you going to do about it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, what do you know about these alleged notes \\ntaken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears \\nthat the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that \\nwhen they say yes they mean no?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that\\'s a complete \\nmisreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the \\nconversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring \\nPresident Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime \\nMinister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister\\'s \\nbelief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  \\nI mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and \\netiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where \\nhe was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese \\nwere serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t   Are you saying that the President said that when \\nthe Japanese say yes they mean no?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s not -- I don\\'t know the \\nexact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say \\nsomething along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime \\nMinister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the \\nJapanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and \\nthere appears to be --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'ve seen the reports in the \\nJapanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It \\ndoes talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of \\nview.  I don\\'t think it\\'s going to be a problem.  I believe that \\nthere may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up \\nbut I\\'m not positive.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, was the specific comment that was made \\nspecific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general \\nobservation on Japanese etiquette?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The specific comment is what I\\'m asking about that \\nhas alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \"when the \\nJapanese say yes they mean no.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean \\nI don\\'t think that\\'s the whole sentence.  I think that the specific \\ncomment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific \\nfinish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that \\nPrime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was he saying it facetiously first?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual \\nobservation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to \\nclear it up.  Has the President sent a message?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don\\'t think the President \\nspoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but \\nI\\'m not sure exactly how many.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you\\'re \\nmaking it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got \\nthe reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that \\nit was understood and make sure there was absolutely no \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the \\nSecretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure \\nthere is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don\\'t believe there is \\non.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they \\nmay have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese \\nis as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two \\ndays.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime \\nMinister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. \\nposition, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the \\nKuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa\\'s \\ncommitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a \\nconstructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to \\nhear that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq \\nfor the last few days, I\\'m a little confused.  What is the U.S. \\npolicy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s the same policy that Secretary \\nChristopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have \\nreiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance \\nwith all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, \\nSaddam can\\'t stay in office?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that\\'s -- our \\njudgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with \\nthe resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that \\nwe expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will \\ncontinue to demand it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And are you concerned the Iran will become the \\ndominant power in the area --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also \\nspoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect \\nfull Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping \\nsupport of terrorism.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s a very glib statement that he won\\'t stay in \\npower if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you \\nbase that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not \\ncomplying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the \\nrights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is \\nnot fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  \\nHe is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding \\narmaments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he \\nwould be out of power?\\n\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on \\nthe repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make \\nit more difficult for him to stay in power.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it \\nthat you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure \\npolitics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence \\ndo you have that they just don\\'t have a genuine idealogical \\ndifference with you that\\'s in good faith?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times \\nin the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the \\nfight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now \\nseek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate \\nRepublicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to \\nthem during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had \\none, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate \\nRepublicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and \\nthinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -\\n-\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I\\'m not sure that it\\'s true \\nthat there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the \\nRepublican leadership on at least two occasions before the \\nintroduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate \\nRepublican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are \\ncontinually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who \\nhave an interest in the President\\'s package.  We are interested in \\nwhat they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is \\nimportant, and we\\'re going to continue to fight for it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats \\nalone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it \\nthrough?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is \\nno question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can \\nfrustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  \\nYou only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going \\nand to stop any action, and that\\'s what the Republicans are doing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     going to rethink the way you attempt to get \\nother things passed as you go through this process for the rest of \\nthe summer?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     work with Republicans and try to woo some \\nRepublicans into your camp?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we\\'re going to continue to \\nlook for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the \\nPresident\\'s intiatives?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But on this one -- how are you going to do it \\ndifferently than you did it on this one because on this one you \\nreally did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear \\nthat it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and \\ncould get it through and you really didn\\'t need Republican votes?  \\nAre you going to take a different tack when you have to go for \\nparticular votes?  When you have to go through --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t see into the future and \\nunderstand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the \\nPresident\\'s going to continue to reach out when he can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You don\\'t have any regrets then about the way you \\nhave handled it up to now and you don\\'t plan any changes in your \\napproach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this \\nexperience?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like \\nhis package passed as quickly as possible and he\\'s going to continue \\nto press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, \\nthere\\'s not question about that.  And we\\'ll continue to reason with \\nthem and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this \\ncase the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around \\na plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  They\\'re being denied any other legislative means of \\nputting their proposals forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they\\'re being --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     any ideas.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being \\ndefeated; I don\\'t know that they\\'re being denied.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     to present them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s not exactly true.  I mean \\nthey get the votes --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     that theirs can be passed though by the \\nparliamentary rules under which they\\'re playing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in \\nsupport all the way around, no, that\\'s not exactly true.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration \\nbacking any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we\\'re pressing for \\nIraqi compliance.  I don\\'t know if we can get into the business of \\ngrooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at \\nsome levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don\\'t know  about \\nanything recently.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the \\nPresident\\'s best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be \\nsome kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the \\nPresident, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider \\nsomething like that, or any other kind of intervention there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President \\nappointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a \\nspecial envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around \\nthe California economic situation, including the situation in Los \\nAngeles.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles \\nby the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, \\nMr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD \\nSecretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits \\nby Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I \\nwouldn\\'t rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to \\nCalifornia.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is \\nconcerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy \\ndecisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities \\nwhich help prevent disturbances.  But we\\'re going to continue to \\nwatch it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also \\nsupposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a \\ngroup of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball \\nmanagement.  Does the President have a position on that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received \\ncorrespondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson \\nhas also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  \\nHe clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in \\nbaseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the \\nPresident intends to continue to go to the ball game.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see \\nReverend Jackson while he\\'s out there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if he is going to see \\nthem, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has \\nraised some serious questions, and it\\'s something that, as I said, \\neven though there has been progress, it\\'s clearly not enough.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball \\ngame?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure about that.  I believe \\nthe characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an \\ninformational pickett.  I don\\'t know that he asked him not to go to \\nthe ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining \\nhis concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the \\nPresident read it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the \\nmanaging partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be \\nthere, and is he going to meet with the President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is the Mubarak schedule?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is \\ncoming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a \\nlunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice \\nPresident Gore.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And joint statements tomorrow --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, \\nyes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did \\nwarn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist \\nactivities?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, \\nI mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been \\ngeneral conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a \\nlong period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I \\nmean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there \\nwas no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  \\nThe President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also \\nreiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, \\napparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, \\nforgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at \\nthe moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in \\ntheir attempts to get some kind of action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know if I would \\nagree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did \\nsay that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a \\nnetwork in the United States and upon which we took appropriate \\naction.  But there was no specific information on this specific \\noperation at all.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So, the White House doesn\\'t feel that any of the \\nlaw enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have \\nreceived this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in \\nnot pursuing some kind of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s next with Serbia?  It got only a passing \\nmention in the news conference yesterday --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn\\'t get to ask your \\nquestion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted \\naction between the two countries?  And even if there wasn\\'t, what \\ndoes the U.S. do next?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going \\nto move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our \\nallies on a sanctions resolution and we\\'ll continue to look for ways \\nto press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an \\nagreement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, why do you think sanctions is still an \\noption?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the \\nleadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait \\nyou out and even the administration officials we had in the other day \\nsaid there\\'s no evidence that they\\'re going to have an effect any \\ntime soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When \\ndoes no mean no and you have to do something different?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something \\ndifferent.  We\\'re moving forward on further sanctions through the \\nU.N. and those discussions will continue.  We\\'re going to continue to \\ntry and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every \\nopportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? \\nMR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something \\nthat is under consideration.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham\\'s \\ncondition, how he\\'s doing?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing\\'s changed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s a little unclear.  I think \\nwe\\'ll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning \\nafter the Mubarak visit.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he going somewhere for Easter?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What more can you tell us about the additional aid \\nto Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s going to be consulting with \\nthe Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  \\nI know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their \\ndelegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the \\nRussians this week and those consultations will continue over the \\nnext several weeks.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude \\nof the one announced Sunday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not going to discuss the \\nmagnitude.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where \\ndo you stand on that --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, \\nhe\\'s going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week \\nand reviewing it.  He believes -- he\\'s going to try and get it this \\nweek and he\\'s going to review the list, and we\\'re going to take a \\nhard look at it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But they\\'re making it up?  I mean it\\'s no White \\nHouse involvement, Congress is compiling this list?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he\\'s going to talk to the \\ncongressional leaders about compiling the list but I\\'m certain we\\'ll \\nbe able to get our own researchers working as well.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, isn\\'t lifting the arms embargo more of a \\nprobability than a possibility?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s something that\\'s under \\ndiscussion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Christopher has said that it\\'s a matter \\nof time and -- for months before that happens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it\\'s \\nsomething that the President is reviewing.  Right now we\\'re working \\nwith our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we\\'ll \\ncontinue to review other matters.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule \\nthis week?  Any travel?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I \\ndon\\'t have anything more beyond tomorrow\\'s visit with Mubarak right \\nnow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish \\nAmerican organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR.

The owners put out a statement few days ago, \\nwhich they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase \\nminority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we \\nshould.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.  \\nAnd I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's \\na legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an \\ninformational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to \\nthe game.  So, I think it's good.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think they're moving fast enough?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first \\nstep.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an \\nissue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to \\ngive it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will \\nhighlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate \\non the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break \\nthat and get cloture?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I \\nmean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one \\nof the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you \\nknow, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate \\nthe majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not \\nlike the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they \\ncan stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a \\nlot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote \\nfor the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political \\npressure not to do it.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when \\nno new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an \\neconomic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're \\nwilling to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston \\nand Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very \\nsad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in \\na hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans \\nhad always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the \\nprogram were people like me who were out there at the grassroots \\nlevel, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they \\nhave chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep \\nAmericans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\",\n",

              "  '\\nSaw it in t.p.m., thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, and the individual is not omitted; I just didn\\'t fully articulate the \\nprinciples of Fractal Federalism.  All government powers derive from the\\nPeople; each level can receive a new power from the level below through \\nthe amendment process, where a true consensus (say a 3/4 majority) writes \\nthat power into the Constitution of the level above (in the case of the \\nlowest level, an amendement is passed by a 3/4 majority vote; in the case \\nof higher levels, it must be passed by 3/4 of the legislatures.  We can\\nof course haggle about the specifics of \"true consensus\" when we hold our \\nConstitutional Convention :-).  Once a power has been granted, it may be \\nexercised by the legislature.  Powers not in the original Constitutions must \\npercolate upward, starting from the individual.  The ratification process \\nfor the original Constitutions should involve consensus and not simply a \\nplurality or majority.\\n\\nGranting a \"right\" in a constitution is of course the same as empowering\\nthe government at that level to restrict the activities of the governments\\nat the lower levels, so it operates in the same way as the amendment process \\n(again, that crazy resemblance to the supposed-but-not-actual U.S. government \\nstructure).\\n\\nThis government structure is a very frustrating one for those people (read-\\n\"liberals\") who would like to have concentrated power to use the government\\nto force people to do \"good\" (a difficult-to-define word, and one that it \\nis difficult to reach a consensus on).  It is also a frustrating structure \\nfor those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior (read- \\n\"big-government conservatives\").  I personally would rather see those types\\nof people frustrated than the incredible erosion of liberty (both civil and \\neconomic) that is going on now.\\n\\nThis is IMHO a \"good\" government stucture for those who see the role of\\ngovernment as the protection of individual liberties, while still recognizing\\nthat individuals need to have some influence in the type of community that\\nthey live in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne which maintains peace, liberty, and the opportunity for happiness for its\\npeople, while working within the realities of human nature.  You do bring\\nup the point (intentional or not) that a \"lasting\" idea is by no means\\nnecessarily a \"successful\" idea.  I believe that Fractal Federalism would\\nat least bring many ideas to light, and The People would have the opportunity\\nto democratically choose between \"good\" ideas and \"bad\" ideas.  If the\\nDocialists, er, I mean Democrats are right and government activism fosters a\\nprosperous People, they will have a plethora of local opportunities to  \\ncheck their thesis.  If Libertopia is possible, it will arise.  If a balanced\\nConservative Republic is democratically received as the best level of\\ngovernment activity, it will become clear to The People that it is best.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRight, and people would not rescind any freedoms (read- \"empower the\\ngovernment\") except through the amendment process.  That is how the Federal \\nGovernment is supposed to work now, but the Supreme Soviet, er, I mean the \\nSupreme Court put a stop to that \"republican government\" nonsense.\\n\\nIn my hypothetical government, if there were a constitutional provision\\nempowering the government to regulate churches the government (whatever\\nlevel we are talking about) could indeed ban churches.  The constitutional\\nprovision would be invalid if a higher level had a constitutional provision\\nprotecting free exercise of religion.  The uppermost Constitution is still\\nthe Supreme Law of the Land.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is a matter of individuals being able to control their own associations\\nand environment, not a matter of suppression of ideas.\\n\\nOne dilemma of the human condition is that individuals need liberty, and\\nthey also need to have some control over their environment.  In my\\n\"Fractal Federalism\" government, certain \"rights\" are protected by the \\nconstitutions.  Other \"rights\" are protected simply because the government \\nhas not been empowered to infringe upon them.  When a consensus is reached\\nthat the government should have a certain power, then freedom is infringed\\nupon.  This cannot be avoided -- murder statutes infringe upon freedom,\\nbut I think that the consensus of the American people is that murder statutes\\nare a good idea.\\n\\nI am sure that many parents believe that they have a \"right\" to control\\nthe environment that their children live in.  People feel that they have\\na \"right\" to sleep peacefully at night; thus, there are noise ordinances.\\nThere are zoning laws that keep businesses from overrunning residential\\nneighborhoods.  I do not view these as bad things (certainly some individual\\ninstances are bad, but the concept is not necessarily bad), I view them\\nas the people in a community having some control over the type of community\\nthat they live in.  I see the alternative as near anarchy.\\n\\nLike I said in another post, if you can come up with a scenario where an \\nindividual can do something truly autonomously -- with absolutely zero\\neffect on anyone else -- then no individual or government has the right\\nto restrict that activity.  There are simply not very many behaviors that\\nfit into the category of the truly autonomous, so the whole thing becomes\\nan issue of one individual or group having power over another individual\\nor group.  I think that the \"Fractal Federalism\" approach is a sound, if\\nnot ideal, approach to limiting this restrictive power.  The libertarian \\nscenario degenerates to \"might makes right,\" and the system we have right\\nnow is one of \"lawyers abusing natural rights philosophy to decide what \\npowers the government should have by subverting the democratic process \\nthough the Supreme Court.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI think I answered this above already, but let me expand a little more\\nwith an example.  If I stand naked in front of your house and masturbate \\nin front of your children while they play, in your libertarian (small \\'l\\')\\nscenario the only recourse you have is to yell at me.  \"Autonomous\" is\\na value judgement 99.99% of the time, it is not a scientific reality with\\na clear definition.  Exactly who would you empower to make that value\\njudgement?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLots of people are long on complaints and short on practical solutions.\\nAlthough I am pessimistic that my idea will ever bear fruit, I am at least\\ntrying to be long on solutions also.  I am truly interested if you have\\nany improvements to make on my ideas (I call them \"my ideas\", but they\\nall come from an \"average guy\" reading of the U.S. Constitution without\\nbenefit of the indoctrination of Constitutional Law academia).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSorry, the confusion was my fault.  When I said that \"Fractal Federalism\" \\nresembles the U.S. constitution, I meant it and thought it was pretty clear.  \\nI should have more clearly explained that the ultimate derivation of government\\npower is from the CONSENSUS of the people (although not the CONSENT of every\\nindividual; a practical observation, not a moral judgement).  It is certainly \\nbetter than having all government power derive from nine lawyers, which is the\\nsituation we have now.  That is why I think the Supreme Court should be\\na jury court, with a different jury for each case.  \\n\\nIt is certainly not perfect (no philosophy of government is), but do you still \\nfind it a repugnant idea?  If so, what is your solution?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI think that you misunderstood the structure of the form of government I\\nadvocate, and it was my fault for not being more clear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe majority does not make the rules.  The majority (or possibly a \\nplurality) simply elects representatives to exercise limited government \\npowers; those limited government powers derive from a large consensus, \\nnot a simple majority.  And the Federal Government, in my scenario, still\\nhas the power to protect freedoms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMatt Freivald\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLiBORGalism:\\n             THINKING IS IRRELEVANT.

But if you're a\\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto\\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same\\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\\n\\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\\nstand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\\ndoesn't have a game like that in him.\\n\\n\\nDon't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about\\nRoussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen\\nat least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was\\nto have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,\\nDom has played well too.\\n\\n\\nFLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame.

You got answers to your questions when\\nyou began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some\\nridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected,\\nchanged the subject with your remarks about having a discussion\\nof substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance,\\nwhy then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss\\nsilly accussations, e.g. \"It really doesn\\'t matter to you...\"\\nIf it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek\\nsome substance?

Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.\\n\\n\\nYou simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is\\nnot accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on\\nfor size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill\\nthe other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments.\\nBut the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the\\nother in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The\\nsystems are dependent on each other for life.  I\\'m still struggling\\nto see anything analagous here and failing to do so.\\n\\n\\nYour argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total\\nfailure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in\\nreality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert\\nthat it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible,\\nthat of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said,\\nyou give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one\\nhand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than\\na hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins\\nmurdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each\\nother in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe\\nin now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions\\nare made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where\\nthey cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said,\\nthere is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim\\nthat is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a\\nclaim on a woman\\'s womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to\\nits claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?\\n\\n\\nYou haven\\'t answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.\\n\\n\\nAgain you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and\\nit is not as slow as you seem to think.\\n\\n\\nYes, and I\\'d hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn\\'s children that\\nhe was murdered by a religious, \"pro-life\" fanatic.  Please do\\ntry to stay relevant.\\n\\n\\nClever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.\\n\\nWhat happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake?\\nWhy does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her\\nkidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What\\nis different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this\\nout for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one\\ncase you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born\\nchild (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus\\ncan), and in this case you recognize a significant difference\\nbetween the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at\\nstake.  You can\\'t have it both ways.  Action and inaction are\\nirrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction\\nanyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have\\nborne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a\\nhealthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as\\nshe chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at\\nparties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and\\nthe provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary\\nthan the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.',\n",

It now has the support \\nof a majority of the United States Senate. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \\nthe economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \\nfast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \\nUnfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \\nhave used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \\nthe will of the majority on the jobs bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \\nstate and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \\nis not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \\nfor full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \\ncare about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \\nthe rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \\ntable and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \\ndignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \\nfamilies and drawing a paycheck.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \\nserving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \\neconomy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \\nwith the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \\nof the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \\nplan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \\njobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \\nnational needs.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \\nToday I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \\nsize package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \\nthe American people. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \\nwill be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \\nminds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \\nthe need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \\ndramatic rise in violent crime. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \\nadditional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \\nto rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \\nfiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \\nmatching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \\n10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \\ncommunities all across our nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \\nviolent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \\npeople have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \\nhomes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \\nAmerica can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \\ninvestment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \\nthe economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no \\nmistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \\never have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \\nfor their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \\nand tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \\nthat I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \\nrehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the \\nsummer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to \\ntalk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement \\nconcern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \\nto have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \\na brighter and more peaceful future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \\nlaw enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \\nthese communities.  I have always supported community policing not \\nonly because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \\nbut because it cements better relationships between people in law \\nenforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \\nthe chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \\nchances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \\nI promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \\nanother 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \\nyears.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind \\nthe core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the \\njobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if \\nyou will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept \\nthe fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to \\nbuilding our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will \\ncreate real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my \\npart now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want now to give the people who are here with me on \\nthe platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the \\nAmerican people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished \\nAttorney General.\\n  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that \\nthe jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over \\nthe suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional \\ndialogue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --\\nthey wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, \\nI made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's \\na lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- \\npeople have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \\nof the present system on many of our major employers, particularly \\nmany of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the \\nstrength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision \\nthat would even approach that on that or any other kind of general \\ntax.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you personally believe that the American public \\nis ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I \\nmean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I \\nwill say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the \\nbenefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --\\neveryone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you \\nstreamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that \\nthere's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or \\nover-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive \\ncare in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows \\nabsolutely massive savings to the health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The real question is whether you can transfer those \\nsavings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have \\nvirtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I \\nhave no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is \\nthe polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, \\nthey say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an \\naffordable health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I don't think that has anything to do with this \\nstimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first \\nand foremost.  They want that more than anything else.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Now that you've announced your willingness to \\ncompromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of \\nyour package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer \\njobs is one.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the \\nhighway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let \\nme say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime \\nbill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a \\nsupplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think \\nwe need to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the \\nenormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately \\nand disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people \\nwith AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be \\ndone.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the \\nsafety of the public depends on that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I \\ndon't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator \\nMitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole \\ncalled me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call \\nhim back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we \\ndiscussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said \\nthat I would not make any statements about any specifics until at \\nleast they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could \\nreach some accord.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been \\nalready, and let's see if they can talk it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator \\nMitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 \\nmillion, that you want that as part of the package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word \\nfor Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator \\nDole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  \\nBut I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I \\nwanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a \\nreformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even \\nmore focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the \\nAmerican people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly \\nconsistent with that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you.\",\n",

              "  ' \\n\\n[Note: This is a repost of my earlier response to Mr. Starr,\\nwhich was not properly formatted.  Apologies to those who\\'ve\\nseen the following before:]\\n\\nTo explain my position on the \"War On Drugs,\" I offer this:\\n\\nDrugs And Crime: A New Approach\\n\\nby Ken Barnes\\n\\n\\nGiven that:\\n\\n1. The trade in illegal drugs is responsible for \\nmuch of the crime which afflicts our nation.\\n\\n2. People who want drugs (particularly people who \\nare predisposed to addiction) will find a way to get \\nthem, whether or not they are legally available.\\n\\n3. Despite current law enforcement efforts, drugs \\nare readily available to those who want them.\\n\\n4. Addiction to drugs, both legal and illegal, is \\nresponsible for a significant drain on the productive \\nresources of our country, and this occurs in a variety \\nof ways, from the cocaine-addicted babies who are \\nunable to learn, to the spread of disease among \\naddicts, to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse \\nand tobacco smoking.\\n\\n5. A general economic principle of government is \\nthat whatever is subsidized you get more of, and \\nwhatever is taxed you get less of.  To be most \\neffective in confronting the nation\\'s drug problem, \\nsome way must be found to utilize these additional \\npowers of government to make drug dealing and drug use \\nless attractive.\\n\\nWhile this country\\'s current efforts to combat \\nlegal drugs have succeeded in some respects, (there is \\na greater awareness of the health consequences of \\nsmoking, and designated-driver programs have helped \\nreduce drunk driving, for example), the same cannot be \\nsaid for the \"war\" on illegal drugs.  There remains a \\ncore group of illegal drug users which support \\ninternational networks of smugglers, pushers, growers, \\nprocessors, kingpins, and gangsters.  These networks \\nand their \"marketing activities,\" which include drive-\\nby shootings, corrupting law enforcement authorities, \\nand smuggling weapons, are directly or indirectly \\nresponsible for a large proportion of the crimes \\ncommitted in our country every day.\\n\\nClearly, illegal drugs and rising crime are \\nlinked.  It takes only a moment\\'s reflection to \\nrecognize how they are linked.  The link is money.  As \\nwith this country\\'s failed effort to prohibit alcohol \\nconsumption, a black market has been created, in which \\ngreedy local monopolies, like the gangsters of a \\nbygone era, have profited enormously from their \\nillegal trade.  The victims of this trade include not \\nonly the innocent people unfortunate enough to be \\ncaught in the crossfire, but, I would argue, the drug \\nusers themselves.\\n\\nWere it not for the black market, and the violent \\nmonopoly of the drug lords, drug users might not be \\nthe thieves, robbers, prostitutes and murderers they \\nhave become in order to pay the high prices the drug \\nlords demand.  In the absence of the drug lords, most  \\nwould be, I believe, simply people with a problem, \\neither a moral problem_or_a medical problem, but_not_a \\ncriminal problem.\\n\\nLet me be clear however, I am_not_advocating that \\nwe let the criminals who have been preying on our \\nsociety for these many years of Prohibition off the \\nhook.  On the contrary, the new approach I advocate is \\none which would not result in either the government or \\nprivate industry getting into the business of \\npromoting crack cocaine, or any other presently \\nillegal drug for that matter.  Neither is it an \\napproach which sees law abiding citizens handing over \\nmore and more of their freedom and privacy in an \\neffort to track down illegal drug users, until \"the \\nland of the free and the home of the brave\" looks like \\na police state.\\n\\nHere then is my proposal:\\n\\n1. Possession and use of all presently illegal \\ndrugs is decriminalized, but buying and selling them \\nremains illegal.  \\'Potheads\\' can grow their own \\nmarijuana (as many already do today), other drug users \\ncan legally import their poison of choice as long as \\nthey pay the tariffs, and a barter economy of drug \\nexperimenters develops.\\n\\n2. Because of the barter economy which supplies \\nthe drug users, the black market profits that have so \\nenriched the drug lords dwindle.  If these drugs can \\nbe obtained for \\'free\\' or next to nothing, why buy \\nthem?  Nevertheless, there will be those who will seek \\nto sell these \"noncommercial\" drugs even at relatively \\nlow prices.  Therefore,\\n\\n3. Law enforcement activity is concentrated on \\nthose individuals who continue to buy and sell, and \\nalso on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to \\nafford even low prices.  But here is where the \\nstrategy begins to differentiate between the drug \\ndealers, the victimizers, and the drug users, their \\nvictims.\\n\\n4. Upon arrest for_any_crime,_suspects are \\npermitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a \\ndrug test.  Those who choose to cooperate are informed \\nthat upon conviction for the crime they are accused \\nof, if they are found to be a drug user, they will be \\ninstitutionalized until they are clean, and only then \\nwill they begin to serve their sentence.  If they \\nchoose to cooperate and are already drug-free, they \\ncan begin to serve their sentence right away.  Those \\nwho choose not to undergo the drug test and are \\nconvicted face stiffer fines and serve longer \\nsentences.\\n\\n5. Institutionalization of drug using criminals \\nserves several purposes:\\n\\nDrug using criminals (and this includes drunk \\nand/or \\'stoned\\' drivers) are separated from their \\nsources of supply, thus reducing the total number of \\ndrug users in society at large, and consequently \\ndecreasing the demand for drugs on the street, putting \\nmore of the remaining drug dealers out of business.\\n\\nInstitutionalization provides an incentive for \\ndrug using criminals to straighten themselves out, \\nbefore becoming part of the general prison population.\\n\\nWhile helping protect society from crime, \\ninstitutionalization could also serve to deter drug \\nusers from becoming criminals, since drug using \\ncriminals, unlike other criminals, would be delayed \\nprior to serving their sentences by the additional \\ntime it takes for them to sober up.\\n\\nInstitutionalization of drug using criminals \\nseparate from the general prison population would also \\nprovide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could \\nvolunteer for research studies of new techniques and \\ntreatments for addictive disease, with the potential \\nto benefit both themselves and others.\\n\\n6. Dealers in illegal drugs are generally not \\ndrug users themselves, and this is particularly true \\nof the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit \\norganizations.  Under this proposal, dealers would be \\nmore readily identifiable, since upon arrest they \\nwould presumably pass the drug test, or else decline \\nto take it in order to avoid having to explain why \\nthey are in possession of drugs when it is apparent \\nthey do not use them.  Declining to take the test, \\nthey would of course face stiffer penalties.  While \\neach case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug \\nwould have to stand on own its merits, the outcome of \\na suspect\\'s drug test could provide additional \\nevidence for the prosecution.\\n\\n7. Just as cigarette taxes have contributed to \\nthe decline of smoking in our country by making \\ncigarettes more costly while at the same time \\nproviding revenue for anti-smoking campaigns, \\nnoncommercial drugs should be taxed, and the money \\ngenerated should be used to combat their use.  \\nEnforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis \\nhowever, and should not be used as an excuse to \\ninfringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial \\ndrug users, since to do so would have the effect of \\nreintroducing Prohibition.\\n\\nInstead, drug users will be encouraged to pay the \\ntax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever \\nfound in their possession during the course of routine \\npolice operations, they will be required to pay the \\ntax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to \\nbe destroyed.  If drug dealers are found to be selling \\nnoncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid, \\nthey will face additional prosecution for evading the \\ntax.  The strategy of adding tax evasion to drug \\ndealing charges is already in use in some \\njurisdictions, but its effectiveness is currently \\nlimited by the illegality of drug possession.\\n\\nRevenue from drug possession taxes and import \\ntariffs would be used to fund anti-drug advertising \\ncampaigns, and provide support to private sector drug \\ntreatment programs for those unable to afford \\ntreatment.\\n\\n8. Taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must \\nbe ended.  Federal support of tobacco farming is both \\nimmoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets, and \\nthe marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands \\nin many states must likewise be eliminated.\\n\\nWhile my proposal would have the effect of \\npermitting the use of what are now illegal drugs, it \\nwould hold the users of all drugs responsible for \\ntheir actions, and I believe, would reduce the harm \\ndrugs have on our society, particularly the crime \\ncaused by the illegal drug trade.  So long as we \\nremain a free nation, with relatively porous borders, \\nand freedom for our citizens to travel, we will always \\nhave a drug problem.  Whether it takes the form of \\nheroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings, drunk \\ndrivers killing and maiming others on our streets, or \\nemphysema patients struggling for breath after a \\nlifetime of smoking, the results are the same: \\nneedless suffering and death.  As a society we must \\nrecognize that while our society permits us to harm \\nourselves with drugs, as we are already doing \\n(regardless of the drug laws), we must take a stand \\nagainst the harm that drugs and drug users cause to \\nothers.  We must particularly oppose the vicious and \\nviolent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug \\nusers.  By taking the profits out of their deadly \\ntrade, my proposal goes a long way towards shutting \\ndown these powerful criminal organizations.\\n\\nThe question of whether drug use is a moral or \\nmedical problem depends on which group of drug users \\nyou\\'re talking about.  Different drugs have different \\neffects, and some are more addictive than others.  The \\naddictiveness of a drug also often varies between \\nindividuals, and so we have some people who can drink \\nalcohol in moderation, while others find they cannot \\nresist the bottle.  Nicotine, which former Surgeon \\nGeneral C. Everett Koop declared to be as addicting as \\nheroin, is a legal drug with known harmful effects, \\nand while some people can stop smoking by willpower \\nalone, others continue to smoke even after treatment \\nfor lung cancer.\\n\\nFor those individuals who can stop taking drugs \\non their own, we may argue that because they have \\nchosen to use them, this represents a moral failure on \\ntheir part, or an unwillingness to face the \\ndifficulties of life.  But for the addicts, while they \\nmay have chosen to use drugs the first time, by the \\ntime they discover their addiction it is too late.  We \\ncannot hold them responsible for their disease, any \\nmore than we would blame someone who is drowning for \\nan inability to swim.  Perhaps they should have known \\nnot to go near the water, or perhaps someone should \\nhave warned them of the danger, but in their present \\ncircumstances warnings will not help.  Neither does it \\nhelp for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing \\nthem weights. \\n',\n",

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Terry, do you have a question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, there\\'s a growing feeling that the \\nWestern response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate.  \\nHolocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, \\nanything to stop the fighting.  Is the United States considering \\ntaking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery \\nsites?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for \\nmore than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for \\nfurther action.  And I want to say, too, let\\'s look at the last three \\nmonths.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and \\nwe have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on \\nenforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes \\ninvestigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace \\nprocess.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much \\ntougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National \\nSecurity Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on \\nimplementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should \\nact.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led \\nfor the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be \\nfair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And \\nthey have troops on the ground there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, \\nnor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think \\nwe will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and \\nwhich has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the \\nadministration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I \\nthink we\\'ll finish that in the near future and then we\\'ll have a \\npolicy and we\\'ll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can I follow up?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic \\ncleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole \\ndifferent level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human \\nhistory.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of \\ninhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of \\nmoving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely \\nbecause of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is \\nespecially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic \\ngroups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have \\nto stand up against it.  I think it\\'s wrong.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in \\nthat region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and \\nthe Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we\\'re making \\nprogress on that front.  But what\\'s going on with the Serbians and \\nthe ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other \\nconflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of \\nthe region.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a \\ngood week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of \\nyour stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong \\nand what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  \\nAre you reassessing?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t really believe that the \\nsituation in Bosnia -- it\\'s not been a good week for the world, but I \\ndon\\'t know that the administration could have made it different.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     On the stimulus package, I\\'d like to put it into the \\nlarger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already \\nfundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We \\nhave abandoned trickle-down economics.  We\\'ve abandoned the policies \\nthat brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion \\nin only a decade.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will \\nreduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low \\nin mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are \\nprobably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages \\nin the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  \\nThat\\'s going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this \\neconomy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we \\nare moving in the right direction economically.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have \\nbegun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the \\nadministration, but people in the Congress whether there is something \\nI could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it \\ndidn\\'t pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  \\nThere are really people still who believe that it\\'s not needed.  I \\njust disagree with that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the recovery -- the economists say it\\'s been \\nunderway for about two years, and we\\'ve still had 16 months of seven-\\npercent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having \\ntrouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an \\nargument there, that while we\\'re waiting for the lower interest rates \\nand the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years \\nto take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go \\nforward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a \\nmajority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted \\nfor a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and \\nvoted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I \\njust misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I\\'ve just \\nbeen here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a \\ncontentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get \\npolitical reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I \\nbasically feel very good about what\\'s happened in the first 100 days \\nwith regard to the Congress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Waco --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don\\'t have \\nmuch to add to what I\\'ve already said.  I think it is a -- I want the \\nsituation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any \\ninsights to bear on that.  I think it\\'s very important that the whole \\nthing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from \\nthe beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do \\nnot think the United States government is responsible for the fact \\nthat a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I\\'m sorry \\nthat they killed their children.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your \\nstimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross \\nPerot said today that you\\'re playing games with the American people \\nin your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus \\npackage.  He said he\\'s going to launch an advertising campaign \\nagainst the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going \\nto handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts \\non the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage \\nsome of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to \\nresubmit them to the Hill?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  \\nWe\\'re going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I\\'m going \\nto be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can \\ndo about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found \\nthat rather amazing.  I don\\'t want to get into an argument with Mr. \\nPerot.  I\\'ll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I \\nwould -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There\\'s a \\nremarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, \\nwe raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  \\nBut, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I think it would be -- I\\'ll be interested to see if \\nmaybe perhaps he\\'s changed his position from his book last year and \\nhe has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I\\'ll be glad to hear them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his \\npolitical criticism?  He\\'s launched a campaign against you.  Do you \\nthink you can sit back and just --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to \\napply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he\\'s \\nchanged his position from the positions he took in the campaign last \\nyear, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he\\'s \\ngot some constructive ideas.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the American people have shown that they\\'re very \\nimpatient with people who don\\'t want to produce results.  And the one \\nthing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- \\neven if they don\\'t agree with what I do -- is that I want to get \\nsomething done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to \\ndo things.  And I want to do things that help people\\'s lives.  So my \\njudgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is \\nconstructive, that takes us beyond some idea I\\'ve proposed that will \\nchange people\\'s lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that \\nought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this \\ndebate and not just to the President.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  \\nYou continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a \\ncriteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many \\noptions thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of \\nparalysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why \\nis it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act \\nunilaterally?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you \\nwould agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining \\nsuperpower, has to act consistent with international law under some \\nmandate of the United Nations.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  But you have a mandate and --\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things \\nthat we have under review.  I haven\\'t ruled out any option for \\naction.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, \\nexcept that we have not discussed and we are not considering the \\nintroduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  \\nWe are not.  \\n\\n\\t     So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would \\nremind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the \\nBritish and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  \\nThey have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have \\nsupported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They \\nwelcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to \\nmake these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And \\nI can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely \\nreassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we \\ncan reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where \\nwe have been.  I don\\'t have any criticism of the British, the French \\nand others about that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Would that be military action?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in \\nyour administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. \\nAmbassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services \\nSecretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which \\nare absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you\\'ve taken in \\nyour administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political \\ngrip?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no \\nchild abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning\\'s \\nnewspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of \\nthese are things you said that you didn\\'t support.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don\\'t know what -- we \\nknow that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is \\nundisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where \\nI come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had \\npeople teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that \\nqualifies as abuse.  And I\\'m not criticizing Judge Sessions because I \\ndon\\'t know exactly what he said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has \\nmade no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press \\nreport that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed \\nher -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new \\ndirection we should take in response to my request to all the senior \\nmembers of my administration to let me know what they thought we \\nought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about \\nwhat they think we ought to do next.  And I\\'m not going to discuss \\nthe recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I \\nmake a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I\\'m going \\nto do.  So I wouldn\\'t say that either one of those examples qualifies \\nspeaking out of school.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala \\nboth said that they thought that that was a good idea.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t mind them saying they think it\\'s \\na good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy \\ngrounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it \\nin the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I \\nhave no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We\\'ve had \\na lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they \\nthought that tax would help make their particular industries more \\ncompetitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn\\'t taking a \\nline against an administration policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and \\nlesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed \\nin the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of \\nthem and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would \\nfulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to \\nmeet their now enhanced expectations?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don\\'t know about that.  And I \\ndon\\'t know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  \\nBut I\\'ll tell you this:  I believe that this country\\'s policies \\nshould be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe \\nwhen you tell people they can\\'t do certain things in this country \\nthat other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and \\ncompelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of \\nour people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a \\npolitical proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 \\nwhen I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I might add -- it\\'s interesting that I have been \\nattacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily \\ncoming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I \\nwas attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights \\nof religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to \\npractice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have \\nalways had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect \\nthe rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest \\nof their capacities, and I\\'m going to stick right with that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated \\nexpectations on their end and criticism among others that has \\nhamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis \\non this issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal \\nof emphasis on it.  It\\'s gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters \\nand in the press.  I\\'ve just simply taken my position and tried to \\nsee it through.  And that\\'s what I do.  It doesn\\'t take a lot of my \\ntime as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, \\nand that\\'s what I\\'ll continue to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in \\nBosnia -- and we understand you haven\\'t made any final decisions on \\nnew options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most \\ncommonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable \\nthe Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited \\nair strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us \\nyour decision -- presumably, you haven\\'t made any final decisions on \\nthose two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going \\nthrough your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final \\ndecision?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I\\'m reluctant to get into this.  There \\nare -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options \\nthat have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have \\nsupporters and opponents within the administration and in the \\nCongress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be \\nrequired to embark on any new policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do believe that on the air strike issue, the \\npronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military \\naction, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes \\naction, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We \\nmust be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The \\nUnited States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a \\nwar.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the \\nquestion obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to \\nfight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will \\nit lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have \\nthat would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I think both of them deserve some serious \\nconsideration, along with some other options we have.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think that these people who are trying to \\nget us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven\\'t \\ntaken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and \\nwe couldn\\'t take care of our prisoners and get them all home from \\nVietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for \\ntreatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of \\nthese wars?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that\\'s a good argument \\nagainst the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent \\nin a war there.  But we are, after all, the world\\'s only super power.  \\nWe do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of \\nsystematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could \\nhave not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and \\ngoodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other \\npractical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts \\nof ethnic tensions exist.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris \\nYeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive \\naction against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has \\nhis political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and \\nhe did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly \\nenough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President \\nYeltsin\\'s campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher \\nsanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper \\ndecision for them and one that the United States and, I\\'m sure, the \\nrest of the free world very much appreciated. \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you\\'d become more \\ninvolved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you \\nhandle that situation differently now?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t think as a practical matter that \\nthe President should become involved in the planning of those kinds \\nof things at that detail.  One of the things that I\\'m sure will come \\nout when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and \\nanswered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions \\nwe should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And \\nI look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did \\nbefore, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once \\nwe knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military \\nbe consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the \\nconflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and \\ntheir obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before \\nthe action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I \\nhave reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were \\nsufficient.  I have -- as I said, I\\'m sure -- I leave it to others to \\nmake the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should \\nhave asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director \\nSessions\\' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on \\nhis future?  And if you haven\\'t, will you give him a personal hearing \\nbefore you do decide?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment \\nof his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no \\nnegative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand \\nby what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And \\nI\\'m waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what \\nto do with the direction of the FBI.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, since you said that one side in \\nBosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to \\nthe nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot \\ntake a partisan view in this war?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of \\nethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That \\ndoes not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter \\na war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of \\nrepublics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately \\nbe successful.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think what the United States has to do is to try to \\nfigure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the \\npeople to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop \\nethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are \\nwrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy \\nproblem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were \\neasy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to \\ndo more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly \\nnot been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now \\nlooking at what else we can do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt \\nadministration for not having bombed the railroads to the \\nconcentration camps and things that were near military targets.  \\nAren\\'t there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct \\nconflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that \\nthe circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with \\nGermany at the time and that\\'s what made that whole incident so --\\nseries of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we\\'ve \\ngot all of our options under review.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge \\nof collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale \\nmilitary operation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don\\'t.  \\nThat\\'s not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and \\nAmbassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps \\ngoing back and forth because of the people who are involved with the \\nde facto government there.  It\\'s obvious what their concerns are.  \\nThey were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the \\nfirst place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to \\npower.  We\\'re working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we \\ndiscuss it at least three times a week, and I\\'m convinced that we\\'re \\ngoing to prevail there and be successful.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do believe that there\\'s every reason to think that \\nthere will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to \\nguarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on \\nboth sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of \\nongoing civilized society.  But I believe we\\'re going to prevail \\nthere.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, would you care to make your \\nassessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I\\'ll say if -- I believe, first of \\nall, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the \\nbiggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration \\nand confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both \\nbring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do \\nit by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of \\nwhich come from the highest income people in this society --reversing \\na 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the \\nmiddle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were \\ngoing up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the \\ntotal national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. \\nWe have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of \\nbillions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people \\nrefinance their debt.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have established a new environmental policy, which is \\ndramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with \\nme and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach \\nin education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing \\nopportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political \\nreform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed \\ntough ethics requirements on my own administration\\'s officials.  \\nThese things are consistent with not only what I said I\\'d do in the \\ncampaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is \\nheading a task force which will literally change the way the federal \\ngovernment operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens \\nof this country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We are working on a whole range of other things.  The \\nwelfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, \\nof course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care \\nissue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for \\nmillions of Americans.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More \\nwill be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of \\nthe motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to \\nme yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  \\nSo I think we\\'re doing fine and we\\'re moving in the right direction.  \\nI feel good about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn\\'t you say, though, that \\none of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now \\npractically finished -- if we can\\'t pass a stimulus bill in our own \\ncountry, how can we do it for them?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  \\nIt\\'s a good question -- (laughter) -- it\\'s a good question, but to be \\nfair we\\'ve got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of \\naid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is \\nplainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we \\nagreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the \\ninternational financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is \\nplainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more \\naid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States \\nCongress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be \\nresolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American \\nworkers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will \\nbe tied by many members of Congress.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  The tailhook report came out this morning, \\ndocumenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the \\nNavy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done \\nabout it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  \\nThe Inspector General\\'s report details conduct which is wrong and \\nwhich has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to \\nbe acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the \\nAmerican people and to all of you that the report should be taken for \\nwhat it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to \\nbe thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general \\nindictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who \\nserve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be \\npursued.  \\n\\n\\t     The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the \\nNavy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I \\nexpected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he \\nwill do that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  \\nThe latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of \\nconfidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not \\nvoters are going to endorse his economic reforms.  \\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.  \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you \\nlive with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in \\norder to then build support for Russian aid?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question \\nis, for the United States, the key question should be that which is \\nposed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins \\nthe election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as \\ntheir President, then I think we should do our best to work with him \\ntoward reform.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the \\nHolocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from \\nEastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former \\nSoviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they \\nconvert from a communist command and control economy to a market \\neconomy in a world where there\\'s economic slowdown everywhere.  And \\nin a world in which there\\'s economic slowdown and difficulty, all \\nleaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll \\nbecause they haven\\'t produced the results that the people so \\nearnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think \\nthat\\'s all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian \\npeople ratify him as their President and stick with him then the \\nUnited States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a \\ngenuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I \\nthink that we should support that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in \\nwhat is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --\\nNAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement \\nand when do you expect to see it accomplished?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think we\\'ll have the agreement ready \\nin the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working \\nwith the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side \\nagreements.  We\\'re trying to work out what the environmental \\nagreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what \\nthe fairest way to deal with enforcement is.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their \\nposition, that they\\'re worried about transferring their sovereignty \\nin enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United \\nStates, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --\\nabout giving that up.  On the other hand, if we\\'re going to have an \\nenvironmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means \\nsomething, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for \\nviolating them.  So what we\\'re trying to do is to agree on an \\napproach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --\\nif you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an \\nisolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be \\nsome enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we\\'re working out \\nthe details of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just \\nan area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think \\nthat we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more \\nclosely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us \\nfrom there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and \\ngives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that\\'s the only \\nway a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and \\nother countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own \\nregion, it\\'s a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry \\nabout how to build those bridges in our own area.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So this is an idea battle.  You know, you\\'ve got a lot \\nof questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every \\none of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you \\nknow, who\\'s for this and who\\'s for that, and if this person is for \\nthis, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things \\nhonestly involved real debates over ideas, over who\\'s right and wrong \\nabout the world toward which we\\'re moving.  And the answers are not \\nself-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for \\nPresident is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating \\nthese ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  \\nSo I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept \\nof NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the \\ndetails needed to be improved.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of \\ninterest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to \\nshow that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General \\nVessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was \\nauthentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal \\nview at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you \\nbelieve that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American \\nprisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey \\nbefore he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high \\nregard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country \\nin this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let \\nme say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it \\nhad been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to \\nundermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are \\nhaving it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the \\nevaluation, we\\'ll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the \\nfamilies of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I \\nthink that we\\'ll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of \\nthe questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last \\ninterchange, but I cannot say that I\\'m fully satisfied that we know \\nall that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don\\'t \\nknow the answer to.  But I do believe we\\'re making some progress.  I \\nwas encouraged by the last trip.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I\\'d like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. \\nnormalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be \\npersonally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be \\nwilling to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to \\nresolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to \\nus to confirm good faith?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never \\nresolve every case, every one, that we couldn\\'t resolve all the cases \\nfor them and that there are still some cases that have not been \\nfactually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I \\nwould have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward \\nresolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, \\nand that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to \\ncontinue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving \\nthose cases.  And we\\'re not there yet.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who \\nknow a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily \\ninfluenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, \\nor whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and \\nthe other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am \\nvery influenced by how the families feel.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     your economic stimulus package, are you doing \\nsome kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, \\nyour legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, \\nthe health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to \\ndo that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob \\nDole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent \\nto which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly \\nafter we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, \\nincluding the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when \\nwe had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 \\nbillion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for \\nsupplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at \\nleast four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated \\nthat.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to \\nnegotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, \\nevery time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had \\npreviously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a \\nstrange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a \\nsignificant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired \\na political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so \\nthat a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, \"Mr. \\nPresident, I\\'d like to be for this, but I can\\'t now.  And we\\'re all \\nstrung out and we\\'re divided.\"  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, \\nwhat I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want \\nto know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and \\nRepublicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to \\nmake it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not \\nthe President and the administration.  The real losers were the \\nhundreds of thousands of people who won\\'t have jobs now.  We could \\nhave put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could \\nhave done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is \\nvery, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  \\nBut the underlying rationale I don\\'t think holds a lot of water --\\nthat it was deficit spending.  That just won\\'t wash.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     and redo --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you \\nmentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to \\npass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point \\nof passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady \\nBill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country \\njust in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we \\nhave seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a \\nwaiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that \\nwe need more police officers on the street.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That\\'s another thing that -- I really believe that once \\nwe move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this \\njobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the \\nstreet who\\'d been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean \\npeople are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. \\nI feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a \\nsecond.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy\\'s \\nsenior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior \\nofficers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated \\nin this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las \\nVegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a \\nright to know the names of the senior officers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of \\nlaw which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now \\nan Inspector General\\'s report and the law must take its course.  If I \\nwere to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which \\nmight be later made in this case.  I don\\'t really think -- I think \\nall I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed \\nby the specific allegations in the Inspector General\\'s report, and I \\nwant appropriate action to be taken.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and \\nappropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am \\nthe Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so \\nas not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action \\nmight proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or \\ncon.  So I can\\'t say any more except to say that I want this thing \\nhandled in an appropriate and thorough way.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification \\non Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of \\nAmerican forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground \\nforces, sir?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if \\nyou fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States \\ninto a ground war there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I just don\\'t want to discuss our \\nevaluation of the options anymore.  I\\'ve told you that there\\'s never \\nbeen a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of \\nground forces into an ongoing conflict there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington \\nthis weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to \\nleave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way \\nparticipating in some of the activities? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn\\'t \\nparticipate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on \\nbalance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should \\nbe done.  But more importantly, I\\'m going to the American Society of \\nNewspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me \\nto make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental \\nissues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will \\nsay something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, \\nasking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, \\nbasically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be \\ntreated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  \\nAnd that\\'s always been my position -- not only for the gays who will \\nbe here, but for others as well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you very much.',\n",

The world now has almost 10\\n  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of\\n  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as\\n  dramatically.\\n\\n    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial\\n  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy\\n  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group\\n  of Seven nations.\\n\\n    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil\\n  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the\\n  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,\\n  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the\\n  overall U.S. economy.\\n\\n    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per\\n  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.\\n\\n    Utilities\\' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side\\n  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource\\n  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not\\n  reduce demand.\\n\\n    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes\\n  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that\\n  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,\\n  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood\\n  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state\\n  at the expense of the individual.\\n\\n    \"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\" is no.\\n  189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an\\n  independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.\\n\\n\\n\\nAvailable from:\\n  Cato Institute\\n  224 Second Street SE\\n  Washington, DC  20003\\n\\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        The Cato Institute\\n\\n    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research\\n  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate\\n  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the\\n  traditional American principles of limited government, individual\\n  liberty, and peace.

Seven hundred to 1500 is the range just about everywhere\\n    else.\\n\\n\\nHow can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world?  The only\\nthing the USA health care system is good at is showering well-insured patients\\nwith a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it.  And\\nthe \"private\" system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient\\nthat it itself sucks up over 100 billion dollars a year in money from every\\nother sector of society - individuals, government, and industry.\\n\\nOf the < 800 billion dollars Americans threw into the bottomless pit of health\\ncare costs last year, the Consumer\\'s Union estimated that at least 200 billion\\nwas thrown away on overpriced, useless, and even downright harmful tests and\\nprocedures, and the most bureaucratic, regulated insurance system in the world.\\n\\nThere are more than 1200 different private insurers in the USA.

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\\n6-3 opening victory.\\n\\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\\n\\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \\nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn\\'t played since March 29.\\n\\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey\\'s backup\\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\\nSaddledome popcorn.\\n\\n\"If I\\'m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I\\'d be\\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\\nplayoffs.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\\n\\nWhile insisting he is the Kings\\' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \\nVancouver on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn\\'t do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\\ngreat goalie is that he isn\\'t satisfied to be a backup.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you\\'re going to be No. 1, you\\'ve\\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You\\'ve got to be able to play when everything\\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\\nmore from him than he does.\"\\n\\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn\\'t play for a month after Knickle was signed\\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\\n\\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \\nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\\n\\n\"What I\\'ve been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?

It\\'s \\na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You\\'re almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \\nyou\\'re No. 1 and if you don\\'t you\\'re No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \\nand then a 75?

They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons\\n drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the\\n front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw\\n personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the\\n floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins;\\n stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table\\n in the process.  Then, they left.  The doors were closed but not\\n latched, much less locked.  The ammo and guns were left unsecured.\\n\\n    \"My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted\\n through and couldn\\'t latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and\\n stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns,\\n the safe -- everything was open and laying around.

There are still quite a lot of people who feel that\\nthe command economies of eastern Europe failed due to corruption rather than\\nessential weaknesses of caommand economies,  and you still have a majority\\nin this nation that favors keeping unenforced and unenforcible laws on\\nthe books in order to \"send a signal\".\\n\\n\\n:It would seem that a society with a \"failed\" government would be an ideal\\n:setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented.

              "  \"-------------------------------------------\\nIt's already in the hands of a monopoly of the rich because of capitalism\\nof land. Other than government land, saved for posterity and the eco-system\\nas well as government function, the remaining land is owned by a smaller\\npercentage of the people than ever before. The game of capitalism is almost\\nwon. The game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters\\ninto our own hands and redistribute it again fairly, or else be enslaved in\\nreturn for a place to live. Here in central California, already, fewer than\\n30% own all the property and 5% of them own 90% of it. That's twice what it\\nwas twenty years ago. Rents are so high that you pay 60% of your income for\\nrent. If you just have a McJob, all you can afford is one room, if that.\\nSome 30% of minimum wage workers are homeless. Unless you both have degrees\\nin technical fields and are working in them, (in the midst of 30%\\nunemployment in high tech jobs!), you will never own anything but a used\\ncar if you choose to have more than one child!!! And everywhere else you\\ncould afford there are no jobs. The only way to get there is to save and\\nnot consume any more than you have to, clothing used, food poor. No movies,\\nno entertainment,, ect. for about five to seven years, and then, if you've\\nsaved $20,000, if you can get together that much, and that's ignoring your\\nkids and working two jobs, then you can buy a home in Arkansas or Missouri\\noutright and live somewhere where they flood every other year! That's an\\nexaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other\\npeople's houses and find a sturdy hill, then you can buy one up there! Also\\nbuy a rowboat. Missouri's not so bad, if you like the sensation of sleeping\\nin a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter. They really\\ndo put those heaters into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough to\\nstart with ether!:) Shit, kill the rich and redistribute the livable\\nproperty. Kill all of them!\\n-RSW\\n\\n---------------------------------------------\\nThe land is simply granted to people who live on it now. Extra is kept for\\nthe future. You get to stay where you are without paying rent. Land that\\nsupports others becomes property of the state. Farmers are welcome to plant\\ncrops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality. If\\nyou want to grow sourgum because you always did, and you aren't doing a\\ngood job, then we let another farmer grow sorghum, and you grow something\\nelse. When people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the\\npublic holdings. No one can sell land, but they can trade places with\\nanybody. No one can lease land. The government will locally distribute the\\nuse of the land not used for residences. Residences that are insufficient\\nto the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house\\nand yard according to need and availability. The local land council who vow\\nto live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness\\nsubject to review by the state and federal land councils. It will cost no\\nmore than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down a\\ndeep dark hole to the owners! Anyone can submit a request for a larger\\nhouse or land to start a business on, depending on a valid business plan\\nand community needs. Heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the public\\ngood or as needed. Heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep and\\nmaintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary in\\nservice to the community. Companies who own many machines are to be divided\\namong the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to valid\\noperators on a need basis. Cost of upkeep is charged. A guild of heavy\\nmachine operators is recognized for safety and training's sake. Their\\ncouncil is a subcouncil to the community council. Etc. Etc. Etc.

The trick is to realize that the old rich have been\\nmaking the rules behind your back and that it's time to kick them off the\\nmerry-go-round. Tax the rich to death. They are the ones that converted\\nyour 60's school lunch program into the joke it is today. They are the ones\\nwho always cut education. They are the ones who always raise the rent when\\nyou get a raise. They are the ones who should be not just dislodged but\\nkilled for their abuse. I have trouble justifying the death penalty for a\\npoor kid who killed and didn't know why not. I have no trouble justifying\\nthe death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed\\ntheir greed! Have you paid rent most of your life? Then you have been\\nenslaved, percentage wise, most of your life. We used to be serfs. Now we\\nare called renters, and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own\\nland they don't use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to\\nown it. Most rents in California are enough to buy the apartment house,\\npaynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with!\\nI have seen the books!

              "  'The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum\\nSunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0\\nshutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke\\na sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from\\nmounting any serious attack.\\n\\nInjuries:\\n\\nPelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.\\n\\nRoster Moves:\\n\\nJason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS\\nsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years\\nold, 6\\'4\", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,\\n12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in\\nthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him\\nup front as well.\\n\\nAndre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period\\nof the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,\\nand played again for Hershey Sunday night.\\n\\nLines:\\n\\nFedyk-Lindros-Recchi\\nBeranek-Brind\\'Amour-Dineen\\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\\nActon-Brown\\n\\nGalley-McGill\\nYushkevich-Cronin\\nCarkner-Hawgood\\nBowen\\n\\nTommy Soderstrom in goal.\\n\\nActon replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.\\n\\nGame Summary:\\n\\nIf the FLYERS played like this every night, they\\'d be in the playoffs this\\nyear. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after\\nscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.\\n\\nJason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.\\nHe had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead\\nof taking the shot he found Brind\\'Amour crashing the net on the other side.\\nA perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa\\'s body should have been a\\ngoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.\\n\\nGarry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when\\nhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing\\nunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The\\nMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept\\naway every rebound.\\n\\nAfter the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind\\'Amour\\ngave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the\\nnet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef\\nBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to\\nget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into\\nthe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for\\na 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.\\n\\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS\\nfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and\\ndefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies\\nwere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.\\nThen Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had\\na chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into\\nhim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno\\nwas a little far from the boards, and Mike \"Mister\" McGeough felt that it\\nwarranted a boarding call at 15:38\\n\\nThe Leafs couldn\\'t get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were\\nvery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.\\n\\nWith time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone\\nand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf\\'s blue line. They were in\\na crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass\\nto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark\\nchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and\\nwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside\\nthe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own\\ngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.\\n\\nThe FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk\\ntripped up Rod Brind\\'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the\\nFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric\\ngloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We\\ncould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove\\nand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was\\nrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal\\nmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where\\nRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,\\nand Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past\\nBobby Clarke\\'s 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at\\n117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.\\n\\nMike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on\\nthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with\\na slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most\\nof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers\\nflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton\\ngot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a\\nhooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood\\'s\\nstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.\\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.\\nBowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski\\ntried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,\\nand just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as\\nnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,\\nbut Soderstrom stoned him.\\n\\nThe FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn\\'t\\nget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.\\n\\nThe FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they\\ndecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a\\nlittle.\\n\\nThe FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the\\nperiod, but couldn\\'t get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making\\nroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros \\n(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)\\nall at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.\\n\\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.\\n\\nAt about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left\\ncircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it\\'s side, and\\nas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards\\nit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the\\nother). Seconds later Rod Brind\\'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the\\nLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom\\nstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through\\nSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept\\naway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was\\nequal and preserved the shutout.\\n\\nRecchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl\\nat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski\\nBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek\\nexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to\\nset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS\\nzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran\\nhis stick across McGill\\'s face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.\\n5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.\\nUpward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got\\na couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!\\nPenalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski\\nand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.\\n\\nSo a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest\\nin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind\\'Amour played catch until\\nHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and\\nblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.\\n\\nThat was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa\\ndid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the\\n3rd. Probably the strongest game I\\'ve seen from the FLYERS since the All Star\\nbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in\\nthe NHL, but he\\'s played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can\\'t\\nremember that he\\'s tied with.\\n\\nNext up it\\'s the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot\\nbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night\\nin Washington would be the official end.\\n\\nFLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points\\nin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6\\ngames to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better\\nthan 5 under in 80).\\n\\nTragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th\\nis 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to\\nlose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS\\nwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie\\nbreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble\\ndown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and\\nfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the\\ngoal for the team to focus on.\\n\\nFLYERS team record watch:\\n\\nEric Lindros:\\n\\n38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points\\n\\n(rookie records)\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nEric Lindros\\t38 1992-93\\t\\tDave Poulin\\t76 1983-84\\nBrian Propp\\t34 1979-80\\t\\tBrian Propp\\t75 1979-80\\nRon Flockhart\\t33 1981-82\\t\\tRon Flockhart\\t72 1981-82\\nDave Poulin\\t31 1983-84\\t\\tEric Lindros\\t67 1992-93\\nBill Barber\\t30 1972-73\\t\\tPelle Eklund\\t66 1985-86\\n\\nMark Recchi:\\n\\n51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.\\n\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nReggie Leach\\t61 1975-76\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t119 1975-76\\nTim Kerr\\t58 1985-86,86-87\\tMark Recchi\\t117 1992-93\\nTim Kerr\\t54 1983-84,84-85\\tBobby Clarke\\t116 1974-75\\nMark Recchi\\t51 1992-93\\t\\tBill Barber\\t112 1975-76\\nRick Macliesh\\t50 1972-73\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t104 1972-73\\nBill Barber\\t50 1975-76\\t\\tRick Macliesh\\t100 1972-73\\nReggie Leach\\t50 1979-80\\n\\nFLYERS career years:\\n\\nPlayer\\t\\tPoints\\tBest Prior Season\\nMark Recchi\\t117\\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\\nRod Brind\\'Amour\\t79\\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\\nGarry Galley\\t58\\t38 (84-85 Kings)\\nBrent Fedyk\\t58\\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\\n\\nThat\\'s all for now...',\n",

In the meantime, \\nwe\\'re going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in \\nthe U.N.  We\\'re going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the \\nnegotiating table.  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something \\nthe President certainly will consider if the Serbs don\\'t come to the \\ntable.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How much longer are you going to give them to come \\nto the table, George?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re working on that right now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s been a long time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On February 19th, the President mentioned the value \\nadded tax in Ohio.  And when he was asked about it later by \\nreporters, he said -- quote -- \"That is a radical change in the tax \\nsystem of the United States.  It\\'s something I think we may have to \\nlook at in the years ahead.\"  Questioned again about it later he \\nsays, \"It is not something that is now under consideration.  If we \\nstart considering it, I\\'ll tell you.\"  It wasn\\'t a trial balloon or \\nanything, he said.  I was just discussing the tax response to a \\nquestion.  Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote -\\n- \"Certainly we\\'re looking at a VAT.\"  What\\'s gone on?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The same with Alice Rivlin this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The health care task force is \\nreviewing a number of options.  They haven\\'t made any decisions yet.  \\nAnd as I have said from this podium time and time again, we\\'re not \\ngoing to comment on decisions that haven\\'t been made.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But you have also said from this podium time and \\ntime again --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Wait a minute.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     that that was not under consideration.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes.  Clinton says, \"It is not something that is \\nnow under consideration.\"  Is that no longer true?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe the working group, as Ms. \\nShalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been \\nmade of any kind.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, I know.  But he said he\\'d tell us about it if \\nit was ever under consideration.  I take it that now he is and he \\ndidn\\'t tell us about it or --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Did he say if it was under \\nconsideration or if it was something to be proposed?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  \"If we start considering I\\'ll tell you.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If it\\'s something to be proposed?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  \"If we start considering it, I\\'ll tell you.\"  \\nThat\\'s a direct quote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The task force has looked at a \\nnumber of different options.  They have not made any decisions yet.  \\nThe President has not made any decisions yet.  This is -- one of the \\nproposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and \\ncast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform \\nthe health care system.  They have cast a very wide net.  They have \\nlooked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of \\ndifferent proposals.  But the President has not made any decisions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, is the President aware of their consideration \\nof this option?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if he\\'s been briefed \\non any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task \\nforce on this specific proposal of any kind.  I don\\'t know that \\nthat\\'s gotten to his level.  He started yesterday to go through with \\nthe task force a very wide range of decisions and I don\\'t believe \\nthat that\\'s been presented to him, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, he\\'s not relying on the USA Today to tell him \\nwhat his task force is considering in the way of taxes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he\\'s going through it in a very \\ndeliberate fashion.  There are a number of decisions that have to be \\nmade.  I don\\'t know that this proposal has reached that decision-\\nmaking point.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If this is still under consideration, that\\'s a \\nchange, at least from what we\\'ve been told by Dee Dee, I think about \\nthree weeks ago or so.  She said, that is not an option, talking \\nabout the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I \\nremember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice.  Is that \\nnot the case?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know if this has \\nbeen presented to the President as something that is being looked at \\nat some level in the task force.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It was ruled it out, though.  I mean, unlike other \\noptions that you\\'ve kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled \\nout.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, this is something that is \\nbeing looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind.  I mean, \\nit doesn\\'t -- it\\'s not necessarily material until you get to the \\ndecision-making phase.  The working groups are looking at hundreds of \\ndifferent options.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If it was ruled out before and it\\'s not ruled out \\nnow, then something has changed, George.  Yes, no?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When a guy says in February --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the working groups are \\nlooking at the widest possible range of options.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So something\\'s changed.  They weren\\'t looking at it \\nbefore; they\\'re looking at it now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don\\'t know if the working \\ngroups have gotten to that point yet.  They are casting a very wide \\nnet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able \\nto sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now \\nare saying that, in fact, it is being considered?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups are \\nlooking at a wide range of options.  They have not --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly \\nruled it out on several occasions in the past month?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t deny that -- I mean, those \\nare the President\\'s words.  Those are very clear.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Subsequent to the President\\'s words, do you deny \\nthat within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled \\nit out?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know about the timing.  I \\nthink what we did was refer back to the President\\'s words and say \\nthey stand.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So don\\'t they stand any longer?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five \\nyears it was ruled out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, those words -- the President \\ndid say that in February.  The working groups are on a separate \\ntrack, and as I said, I don\\'t believe --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Separate from the President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t believe this has been \\npresented to the President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are they considering something that the President \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has ruled out?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     has ruled out?  I mean, will the President \\nconsider a VAT tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups have not \\npresented this to the President.  They have looked at a wide range of \\noptions.  I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly \\nlisten to it.  That does not mean he has decided to do it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we put this another way?  In his answer in \\nOhio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax \\nsystem.  Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it \\nmight be considered at some future point.  Is that no longer the \\ncase, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I\\'m not sure exactly what \\nyou\\'re asking.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He talked about the VAT in the context of a \\nrestructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health \\ncare, for example.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Or anything else.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Or anything else.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It was always in the context of substituting for \\nother taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has that change, too?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that still his view?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I haven\\'t spoken about those \\nspecific comments.  I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the \\nworking groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT?  Yes, \\nthey have.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Certainly we\\'re looking at a VAT, she said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They have examined the possibility \\nof a VAT.  Has it been presented to the President?  Has he made a \\ndecision?  No, he has not.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What kind of a deal do you have when you\\'ve got the \\nPresident\\'s appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his \\nruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line \\nreform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has \\nspecifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then \\ngoes ahead and announces that that\\'s what they\\'re looking at?  Is the \\nPresident concerned about that sort of thing?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that the President\\'s \\nconcern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal \\npossible.  He\\'s concerned with making sure that they have the most \\nthorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the \\ndifferent alternatives.  If a decision is made to go forward with \\nsomething like that it\\'s certainly something the President will \\nexplain and justify.  But no decision has been made along those \\nlines.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What does it mean exactly, though, when the \\nPresident rules something out?  Does it mean it can get back on the \\ntable later if a more persuasive argument is made?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s just -- that\\'s indisputably \\ntrue.  If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in.  He \\nhas not made a proposal.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What makes him open to it now when he wasn\\'t open \\nto it before?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s certainly willing to listen to \\nthe argument.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was he willing to listen to the argument for a \\nshort-term tax this year, and he wasn\\'t willing to listen to it in \\nChilicothe?  He\\'s now open to it --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The context of his comments was \\nthat it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not \\nsomething he was proposing, not something he was floating.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Not something he was considering.  Those are his \\nwords -- \"It\\'s not something that\\'s now under consideration.  If we \\nstart considering it, I\\'ll tell you.\"  You\\'re now acknowledging, are \\nyou not, that it is under consideration and --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m acknowledging that the task \\nforce has studied this proposal.  I am also stating that the \\nPresident has not made a decision on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But the door is open for the President to \\nreconsider including this as part of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously, the working groups are \\nlooking at it.  Again, but the President has not made a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if they will make a presentation on \\nbehalf of the VAT to him?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know that.  I assume that \\nif -- I don\\'t know what stage they are it in proposing.  I don\\'t know \\nthat they\\'re going to make the conclusion that this is something they \\nshould present to him.  I know this is something the working groups \\nare looking at.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you understand, George, that none of us are \\nasking these questions in context of a decision that the President \\nhas made, only about what the President is considering?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I understand that, and I am \\nacknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a \\nVAT.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And the President will consider it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I assume that he will consider the \\nargument if it is presented to him.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does that mean the President -- that working groups \\nthink that when the President says no, he means maybe?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that means that the working \\ngroups are trying to do the most thorough job possible.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, can I ask you another question about \\nBosnia?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, he wants us to stay on this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Let\\'s do gays in the military.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, he got out of that swamp.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I think we\\'ve gotten the bottom line on that VAT.  \\nReggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said \\nthat if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked \\nout -- quote -- \"We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the \\narms embargo together with our allies.\"  That seems to go a bit \\nfurther than what you\\'ve just said --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sounds almost exactly what I just \\nsaid.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept \\nwhat Reggie --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President has said that \\nthis is something that\\'s under consideration.  It is something he \\nwill consider if the current actions don\\'t bring the Serbs to the \\ntable.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t there some kind of timetable here?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, there is a timetable.  There\\'s \\ngoing to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s on sanctions, that\\'s on tightening the \\nsanctions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s right, that\\'s sanctions.  \\nAnd we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope \\nthat that will bring the Serbs to the table.  As you know, Mr. \\nBartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also \\nworking on ways to bring the Serbs to the table.  We will continue to \\npressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option \\nas well.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The question is whether there\\'s a timetable for \\nconsideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo, \\nnot the sanctions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The next vote in the U.N. is on \\nsanctions.  As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting \\nthe arms embargo.  But it is something that we have discussed both \\ninternally and with our allies.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the \\nU.S. would do that?  What was the point of his telling them that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, clearly, I mean, this is \\nsomething that\\'s under consideration, and this is something that we \\ntake quite seriously if they do not come to the table.  They should \\nknow the consequences of failing to come to the table.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have they been given a deadline?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing \\nand it hasn\\'t seemed to change the Serbs\\' behavior in the least.  Why \\nshould the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo \\nwhen so far everything that\\'s been done has had no effect on the \\nfighting in Bosnia?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don\\'t accept the premise of \\nyour question.  It has had an effect; the embargo is having an \\neffect.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What effect?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If the Serbians choose not to heed \\nour warnings, then they will face the consequences.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What effect has it had in Bosnia?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the effect that it has had on \\nthe Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their \\nshipments through.  We can brief more fully --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In Bosnia, George.  In Bosnia what effect has it \\nhad?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it\\'s hard to say if it\\'s \\nstopped the aggression to date.  That is why we\\'re continuing to \\npress for the Serbians to stop.  But we believe that over time we \\nwill continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect.  \\nI\\'m not saying it\\'s going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn\\'t \\nhappened overnight.  But we believe that over time the sanctions can \\nweaken the Serbs.  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come \\nto the negotiating table, we\\'ll move forward with the embargo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t there a working deadline, George, of the 24th \\n-- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote?  Hasn\\'t the \\nUnited States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if \\nthe Serbs aren\\'t willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that \\nwe\\'ll seek -- haven\\'t we said that we will seek --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'ve said continually we\\'re going \\nto --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But on that deadline?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t have a specific date, but \\nwe\\'re going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution, \\nby around that time.  And if that fails to take effect, if that fails \\nto bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other \\nactions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t this awfully incremental?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re taking a step-by-step \\napproach.  We\\'re ratcheting up the pressure and we\\'re going to \\ncontinue to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there a possibility, George, that by the time \\nall these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved \\ntheir goals and then what\\'s the purpose?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the purpose is to get the \\nSerbs to stop the aggression.  We are pursuing that goal on many \\ndifferent fronts.  We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we\\'re \\npursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through \\ntightening the sanctions.  And we will consider lifting the arms \\nembargo.  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will \\ncontinue to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in \\ngetting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any \\ncampaign be to have the Serbs give back what they\\'ve gained?  I mean, \\nonce they\\'re entrenched --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t speculate on that.  We\\'re \\ngoing to continue to press for them to come to the table now.  We\\'re \\ngoing to continue to find ways to stop the aggression.  But I can\\'t \\nsee into the future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans \\nsay they\\'re going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to \\ntry and explain the details of your package.  They cite polls which \\nshow that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.  \\nWhat\\'s your strategy to counter that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The strategy we have is the one \\nwe\\'re going to continue.  As you saw, the President today pointed up \\nthe very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package \\nwill provide:  700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner \\ncities and suburbs to do productive work.  We are also going to point \\nout the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways.  \\nWe\\'re going to point up the benefits of immunization.  We\\'re going to \\npoint up the benefits of Head Start.  We are going to say that the \\nRepublicans have a choice:  they can take action to create jobs or \\nthey can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does it concern you, though, that the House now, \\nthe House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House Republicans voted against \\nit before.  They made a mistake then; they\\'re making a mistake now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, does it strike anybody in the \\nadministration that it\\'s a bit strong to describe, as the President \\ndid this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- \"a \\nreaffirmation of a promise of America\"?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I think it\\'s the \\npromise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full \\npotential. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Government-funded jobs?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To give people a chance to work?  \\nAbsolutely.  That is the promise of America.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday \\n-- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is on top of.  I did look at \\nit.  There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline.  This \\nwill be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus \\npackage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where does that number come from?  Because we\\'ve \\nbeen told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000 \\nnew jobs.  And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something \\nlike 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, but the summer -- that\\'s when \\nyou do their full-time equivalence.  I mean, 700,000 individuals will \\nreceive jobs this summer.  When you calculate it for the full-time \\njob effect, you have to do -- I don\\'t know what the exact formula is.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- 150,000 or --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  One to four because it\\'s three months.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can I follow up on that?  Did the President \\nmisspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money \\nfor these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the \\nprivate sector?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not necessarily.  I mean, I think \\nthat there will be grants available.  That\\'s one of the ways that you \\npay for the jobs.  At the same time, he\\'s also issued a challenge to \\nthe private sector to hire kids on their own as well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to \\nwork at Time-Warner?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the Time-Warner is actually \\nsomebody coming forward and actually doing a grant.  That\\'s going to \\nbe the bulk of it.  There could be isolated instances, though, where \\nthere would be grants to businesses.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has the President spoken with any Senate \\nRepublicans this week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  \\nNo, but there\\'s been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the \\nWhite House.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  At a lower level.  But the President hasn\\'t?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has not, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Getting any closer to get the votes?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re continuing to work on it. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Anybody leaning your way?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting \\nsomething of a breakthrough in Aristide\\'s attitude towards the coup \\nleaders.  Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what \\nimpact will it have on the process?  And what did Pezzullo have to \\nsay yesterday in his report?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pezzullo did brief the principals.  \\nI can\\'t confirm what\\'s actually happening in the talks.  I would \\nleave that to the negotiators themselves.  But Mr. Caputo has \\nreturned to Haiti.  We have received a briefing here at the White \\nHouse from Ambassador Pezzullo.  And as we have said time and time \\nagain, we believe that assurances of security are important to a \\nfinal resolution to a broader political settlement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, yesterday you offered some selective \\nbreakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities.  \\nCan we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be \\nimpacted?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we have it for most states, \\nyes.  And I think we can get it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you make that generally available?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe we can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And could you do it by the component of the \\nstimulus?  In other words --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if we can do -- I know \\nthat we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs.  I don\\'t know how \\ndeeply it can be broken down.  But clearly, we can break it down into \\nsummer jobs and other jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And can I follow up?  Is this the information that \\nJeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the \\nstates?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if they\\'re ads, but \\nthey\\'re press releases.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you describe what those press releases contain?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All we\\'re doing is pointing out the \\nbenefits of this package to various states.  For instance, I know \\nthat today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire.  \\nAnd I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package \\ncreates 1,000 jobs in Vermont.  It creates 2,000 jobs in New \\nHampshire.  And the people of those states should remind him that \\nthis is important. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where are the releases going?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They go to the states.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To whom?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We can get them.  It\\'s no problem.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we get it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why don\\'t you put them out here as well?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This afternoon?  Would that be possible?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'ll have to check.  I don\\'t know.  \\nBut as soon as we can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you focusing these press releases on states \\nwhere there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we\\'re trying to get as many \\nas we can.  It\\'s actually quite difficult to pull this together and \\nwe\\'re doing our best.  We\\'re putting them out as we get them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole\\'s \\nschedule?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I was just following it. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are press releases going along to states where he\\'s \\nvisiting?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure.  I think that \\nprobably there are press releases going to Vermont.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting?  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, as the President goes about the business of \\ndefending what\\'s in his stimulus package, he doesn\\'t address what \\nseems to be the Republicans\\' main point, that you\\'re funding it with \\ndeficit spending rather than \"if it\\'s so important, why not come up \\nwith the funding for it\" seems to be the Republican argument.  And \\nhow do you answer that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was answer is, we are paying \\nfor it over time.  And if you look at our budget, we pay for this \\npackage over time.  We believe right now the economy needs a jump-\\nstart for jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You\\'re not claiming, are you, that that doesn\\'t add \\nto the deficit this year?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m saying we\\'re paying for it over \\ntime.  I didn\\'t say that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know that, George.  But I mean, from the \\nbeginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things --\\ndeficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This year they clearly will.  But \\nover time our budget fully pays for this program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What you\\'re saying is that there are savings that \\nwould cover this if it were this year in future years?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  That\\'s exactly what I \\nsaid.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know that, but there is going to be outstanding \\ndebt, it will add to the national debt from this year --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, we\\'re reducing the deficit by \\n$500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You mean you\\'re reducing it below what it would \\nhave been?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Exactly.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In fact, you\\'re adding a very large amount to the \\nnational debt over the period of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But we\\'re reducing it far more from \\nwhat it would have been.  That\\'s true.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Washington-type reduction.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You\\'re getting to be a grumpy old man.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, has any decision been made about the White \\nHouse or the President\\'s participation in the gay rights march coming \\nup in a week and a half?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re working on the President\\'s \\nschedule now.  I believe he\\'s going to be at the Senate Democratic \\nretreat in Jamestown that weekend.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will he address it by phone?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know about that.  It\\'s a \\nlittle far out, but I believe he\\'s going to be in the Senate retreat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So will he have the leaders in a day or two before \\nthe speech?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.  I would expect that \\nat some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups.  \\nI don\\'t know the schedule on it, though.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in \\nconjunction with the event?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m just not sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  April 22nd is Earth Day.  What is the President \\ngoing to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign \\nthe biodiversity treaty that day?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know there\\'s been some work on \\nthe biodiversity treaty.  I don\\'t know about signing it that day, but \\nI would expect he\\'ll have a statement on Earth Day or right around \\nthen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'d have to check with Katie \\nMcGinty.  I just know that there\\'s been some work done, but I don\\'t \\nknow exactly what.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When is Earth Day?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The 22nd, I think.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why is it you know that he is going to have a \\nstatement on Earth Day but you don\\'t know if he\\'s going to have a \\nstatement on the gay rights march?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I said I don\\'t know if he\\'s going \\nto meet or when he\\'s going to meet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you have a statement on the gay rights march?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t, actually, no.  I wouldn\\'t \\nbe surprised if he did, though.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s a working visit on Friday and \\nthe President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of \\nissues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and \\nthe trade issues between the two countries.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There was some expectations that a second aid \\npackage to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if \\nI understand, it hasn\\'t happened.  Why is that or what\\'s the status \\non that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The G-7 meeting is still going on \\nand, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked \\nabout the outlines of a possible package.  But we\\'re going to \\ncontinue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q?\\t    We will not then make any kind of announcement \\nduring the two-day meeting?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The meeting\\'s not over yet.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that when you\\'re going to make one?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not ruling out the possibility.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     the President\\'s going to announce it tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Bentsen said that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, Bentsen said it would be tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So did Christopher.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'d have to look at that, but I \\nbelieve it is more likely that the announcement will come out of \\nTokyo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, has there been further consideration here \\nabout going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know that there\\'s -- it\\'s \\nnot something we\\'ve ruled out.  We don\\'t have a date set for it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, you all have a position or do you support \\nImmigration\\'s plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United \\nStates?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s the first I\\'ve heard of it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, there was a report today about the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Fortunately.  (Laughter.) \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     about the pace of appointments and says that \\nPresident Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions \\nthat people have been nominated for.  Are you going to speed up the \\npace of nominations or where do you stand with it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We filled 814 of the President\\'s \\nappointments.  And it\\'s broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147 \\nnoncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time.  I\\'m not sure what that means --\\n(laughter) -- 70 PA full-time.  And this is about the same -- it\\'s \\nabout the same pace of President Bush.  Obviously, as you move along \\nfarther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a \\nmultiplier effect and frees up far more appointments.  So we expect \\nthe process to speed up.  But we\\'re at the pace of Bush.  Obviously \\nwe\\'d like to get these done as quickly as possible.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would point out that the FBI background checks and the \\nbackground check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time \\nthan our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup.  But we\\'re \\nworking on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that because of Nannygate?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that\\'s an awful big part of \\nit, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In the story this morning, you were at \\napproximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way \\nbehind in winning confirmations.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s where the background checks \\ncomes into play.  That\\'s the problem.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s the background checks problem?  Because I \\nmean, you have a Democratic Senate --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, that\\'s not the -- you make the \\nappointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all \\nthe forms and have the background checks done.  That\\'s exactly where \\nthe problem is.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the President doing this afternoon, and \\nwhat\\'s on the plan for tomorrow?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s got some meetings -- just \\noffice meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of \\nissues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues.  And then \\nhe\\'ll be -- tomorrow we\\'ll have an event, probably again focused on \\nthe stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House.  And \\nFriday is the Miyazawa meeting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow, \\nGeorge?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Either tomorrow or Friday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the \\nJapanese Prime Minister\\'s visit tomorrow?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know about tomorrow, but \\nwe\\'ll probably get something done, as we usually do, for these \\nvisits.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you \\nknow what that was about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was here.  He met with a group \\nof us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Who?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Reverend Jackson.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Reverend Jackson.  Mack McLarty, \\nme, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Talking about Haiti?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We talked about general urban \\npolicy.  He is about to go to Los Angeles.  He was just back from \\nMississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he\\'s going \\non to Los Angeles.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did he request the meeting?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Actually, no.  He\\'s in continual \\ncontact with the President.  He had written a letter on a variety of \\nissues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords \\ntonight in Vermont.  Have you guys been  in contact with Jeffords at \\nall on this?\\n\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there\\'s been some contact, \\nsure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us about the contacts?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure -- \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know who contacted him or what was said?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that Howard Paster talked to \\nhim and they just has a general talk about the package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And did he express his support for it now, or is he \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t divulge the details of the \\nconversation, but there have been conversations.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion --\\nelective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care \\npackage.  Is this something the President is considering?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Along with the VAT?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s certainly something that\\'s \\nbeen looked at, but no decisions have been made.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What was the question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The L.A. Times story on whether \\nabortions will be covered by the President\\'s health plan.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your \\nmeeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice \\nabout what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of \\nthe verdict in L.A.?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we certainly talked about the \\nsituation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic \\ndevelopment and other issues.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  For instance, did you discuss whether it would be \\nhelpful for the President to go there or not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we discussed a wide range of \\nissues related to Los Angeles.  That was certainly one of them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in, \\nI need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, good.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     your reaction to Margaret Thatcher\\'s comments \\nthat you\\'re just sitting by and watching a massacre.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we\\'ve been pushing very hard \\non a number of fronts for more aggressive action.  We will continue \\nto do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us if you\\'ve made any progress in your \\ntalks on the stimulus package getting a compromise?  I mean, we don\\'t \\nhave any feel except talks are ongoing.  Have you talked to like 20 \\npeople or --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know the numbers.  We\\'ve \\ntalked to several people and we\\'ve had wide-ranging sessions.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Anyone leaning your way?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t get into that.

              "  \"\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\nYour statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In the\\nGerman Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the\\nlargest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and\\ngenerally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective\\nmajority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to\\nthe Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false\\nas well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January\\n1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by\\nHitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election\\nfor President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg\\n49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election\\nin April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.\\nSo we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of\\nGerman voters.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in\\nReichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election\\nthe Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of\\nthe 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the\\nCommunists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National\\nparty, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million\\nof the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large\\nparty was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but\\nI think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.\\nThus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed\\nChancellor.\\n\\nWhat brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for\\nHitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to\\nput their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government\\nfor the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and\\ntheir parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the\\ninterests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a\\nnumber of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific\\nobjectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the\\ndemocratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other\\nparties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also\\nout to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and\\ngenerally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.\\n\\nGermany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition\\nfor five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and\\nthere certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.\\nIf anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed\\nto get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had\\nbegun to decline.\\n\\nHitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his\\nsecond choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After\\nthe November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed\\non von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back\\nand support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,\\nwho became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold\\ntogether a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to\\nparticipate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of\\nthe Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the\\nparty at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,\\nknowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain\\npower lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country\\nwas governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though\\nthe Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to\\nachieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition\\nparties to work together.\\n\\nHere's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:\\n\\n   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their\\n   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,\\n   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of\\n   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their\\n   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine\\n   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm\\n   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.\\n\\nTrue, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. But\\nthat doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him\\n*before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler to\\ntake over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties\\n(Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis.\\nHitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see\\nthe government paralyzed as a means to taking it over.\\n\",\n",

              "  '\\n                          ^^\\n      \\n\\n\\nFunny you should mention it...this is exactly the case I was going to make.\\n\\n\\nI will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks. \\nBut this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase \\nwill last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking\\none.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support\\nthem.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you\\'d have knee surgery\\nfor some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  \\n\\n\\nOk.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book. \\n\\n\\nYou can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that\\nit wasn\\'t Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I\\'m nit-picking and mincing words, go back\\nand read from where this thread started...\\n\\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan\\'s mind who suddenly\\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\\namazing, I\\'ll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we\\'ve got a *kick*\\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I\\'ll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don\\'t go to\\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\\nholders in LA don\\'t always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\\ninitial success following Gretzky\\'s arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \\n\\nWhether or not the Kings are a \\'winner\\' is debatable.  I claim that since\\nGretzky\\'s arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\\ndynasty...but that\\'s another story and included only because I don\\'t like\\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\\n\\n\\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it\\'s inevitable that the team\\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\\nmake people around them better.\\n\\n\\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\\n\\n\\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn\\'t resist...>\\n\\n\\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It\\'s difficult to predict, but do you think\\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\\nwill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that\\ncase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without\\nSelanne.',\n",

The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\",\n",
              "  \"\\n\\nyet.\\n\\nI'm not bored either.  Most people I know say that winning the second Cup\\nwas better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one.\\nBut I'm every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm\\nto which Susan originally referred.  Inner calm is not boredom.\\n\\nAs far as the arena in general being boring, well Richard's got that right.\\nIt's been that way all season.  I attribute it to a lot of new fans who\\njust don't have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans.  At\\nlast Tuesday's game, I overheard a man express surprise that a\\ngoaltender can get an\\nassist.\\n\\nAnyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen\\nat any time.  I'm confident in the Pens but I'm also not stupid enough to\\nthink for one minute that it's impossible for New Jersey to blow them out\\nof this series.  I doubt that will happen but it's possible.  Bored?  Uh-uh.\\nSpoiled?  Not in the least.  Forgot what excitement is like?  Living through\\nthat amazing streak wasn't exciting?!  I don't take a darned thing for\\ngranted.  God, look at Chicago...\\n\\nAnd I see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway.  It isn't gonna\\nlast forever and I intend to enjoy it while I can.  \",\n",

This so called \"Earth Summit\" is \\nscheduled to convene in  Brazil in June 1992 and aims to impose a system of \\nglobal envionmental regulations, including onerous taxes on energy fuels, on \\nthe population of the United States and other industrialized nations.\\nSuch policy initiatives derive from highly uncetain scientific theories. They \\nare based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming \\nfollows from the burning of fossill fuels and requires immediate action. We \\ndo not agree. \\nA survey of U.S. Atmospheric scientists, conducted in the summer of 1991, \\nconfirms that there is  no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming \\nobserved during the past century. A recently published research paper even \\nsuggests sunspot variability (which is directly proportional to solar \\nactivity),  rather  than a rise in greenhouse gases is responsible for the \\nglobal temperature increases and decreases recoded since about 1880.\\nFuthermore, the majority of scientific participants in the survey agreed that \\nthe theoretical climate climate models used to predict a future warming \\ncannot be relied upon and are not validated by the existing climate record. \\nYet all predictions are based on such theoretical models.\\nFinally, agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide \\nlevels from fossil fuels burning has beneficial effects on most crops and on \\nworld food supply.\\nWe are disturbed that activists, anxious to stop energy and economic growth, \\nare pushing ahead with drastic policies without taking notice of recent \\nchanges in the underlying science. We fear that the rush to impose global \\nregulations will have catastrophic impacts on the world economy, on jobs, \\nstandards of living, and health care, with the most severe consequences \\nfalling on developing countries and the  poor.\\nDavid B.

(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll \\ngive you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The first is that this is the meeting of the \\nPresidents, so the money that's being promised is government \\nmoney, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the \\ngovernment.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going \\nto be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian \\nbusinesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What \\nare the priorities, because there are several association of \\nRussian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to \\nparticipate in setting up priorities for investment?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know \\nthat polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans \\nare very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls \\nsay that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times \\npublished that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; \\n42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent \\nif it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to \\nsort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not \\nvery enthusiastic?  Thank you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going \\nto be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the \\nanswers.  Just the answers.  Okay.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, \\nit depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, \\nthe funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will \\nobviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be \\ngood risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will \\nbe used to support the privatization of existing public \\nenterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the \\nDemocracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have \\nsome influence over the distribution of.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to your second question, let me say that \\nI would think that there would be people in both countries who \\nwould not feel too warmly toward simply the American government \\ngiving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to \\nthat in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history \\nthere has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That \\nis, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole \\nhistory of America, any kind of aid program has always been \\nunpopular.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is \\nthis is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that \\nthis is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --\\ntrillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments \\nbecause of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in \\nRussia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them \\nworking on a democracy and struggling to get their economies \\ngoing, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it \\npossible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the \\neconomy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and \\ninvestment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce \\nnuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on \\nour side and on the Russian side.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an \\ninvestment for the United States.  This is very much in the \\ninterest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the \\nsecond stage of the program, which I hope to put together next \\nweek, in my view are things that are good for my country and for \\nthe taxpayers and workers of my country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Russia is a very great nation that needs some \\npartnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share \\nher goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view \\nthis as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not \\nwhat it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful \\ninvestment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But \\nthere's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than \\nthe $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier \\nof the Cold War.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, first of all thank you very \\nmuch, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory \\nof the living correspondents, this is the first time an American \\nPresident is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind \\nof a very measured breakthrough.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory \\nremarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief \\nthat you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you \\ntell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to \\nwhat might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification \\nof START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how \\nconfident you are that the United States Congress would be eager \\nto support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions \\ninherited from the Cold War?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of \\nUkraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with \\nregard to the need to proceed to have the other independent \\nstates all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States \\ndevelop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing \\nthat we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of \\nthe Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude \\nour own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that \\nwould provide not only an important economic opportunity for \\nRussia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out \\non our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed \\noff on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and \\nwe agreed to continue to press that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to \\nreassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the \\nForeign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the \\nUnited States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, \\nbut that, in order to do what we need to do together to \\nstrengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States \\nbe fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join \\nthe NPT regime is critical.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     What was the second question?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and \\nCOCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the \\nRepublican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, \\nas soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other \\nrestrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on \\nrelations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies \\nof the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of \\nthem we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the \\nleadership of the Congress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be \\nan openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there \\nare, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to \\nemigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there \\nis no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed \\nto affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be \\nmuch less.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing \\nmore than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my \\nown advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement \\nout of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to \\nbegin it in the fairly near future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in \\nAnnapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely \\ndifferent personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not \\npolitical approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of \\nMr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the \\ndifference between you as a personality and your approach -- the \\ndifference between your approach to Russia and the approach of \\nMr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the \\nlast part of your speech?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to \\ncompare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say \\nwhat was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a \\nboy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the \\nmusic and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been \\nthrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music \\nfor more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists \\nand many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know \\nas much as I could about your history.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then \\nthe Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last \\npresidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone \\nin Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. \\nYeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I \\nwas following events there very closely and hoping for the day \\nwhen we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a \\npersonal feeling about Russia.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like \\nmusic very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a \\nmusician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York \\nPhilharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony \\nto the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly \\nthan anyone had ever played it before because it was technically \\nso difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it \\noccurred.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     These are things that have always had a big impact \\non my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever \\nhad the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two \\ncountries become closer partners.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\",\n",

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your\\n   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.\\n\\n2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the\\n   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you\\n   are thrown out of the game, and fined.\\n\\n3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot\\n   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.\\n\\nBesides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties\\nin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,\\nuntil the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in\\nthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.\\n\\nThis works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most\\nexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.\\nNext, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can\\ntake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network\\nannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and\\nMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before\\nthe PA announcer says it.\\n\\nOh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play\\ncannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network\\ncan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told\\nthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a \\nchance of pronouncing his name right.\\n\\nSeriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,\\nfor the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is\\nso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting\\ncontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their \\nroutines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods\\neither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The\\ngame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a\\n10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.\\n\\nThe reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in\\ncommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.\\nOn TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch\\nit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then\\nit truly is a sad day.\\n\\nEnough for now.\",\n",

EDT\\n\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \\nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \\nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \\nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \\nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \\npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \\nthose who are here.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \\nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \\ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \\nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \\ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \\nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \\ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \\nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \\nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \\ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \\ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \\nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \\ntake us into the future.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \\nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \\nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \\nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \\nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \\njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \\ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \\nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \\ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \\nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \\nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \\non the right track.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \\nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \\nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \\npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \\nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \\nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \\nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \\nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \\n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \\nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \\nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \\nis learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \\nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \\nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \\nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \\npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \\nhere today.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \\neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \\nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \\nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \\nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \\nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \\njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \\ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \\nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \\npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \\nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \\nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \\nfor them to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \\nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \\nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \\nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \\nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \\nI have proposed to create jobs. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \\nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \\nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \\npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \\ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \\npeople.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But it is especially important for America for two \\nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \\naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \\ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \\neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \\nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \\nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \\nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \\nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \\nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \\norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \\nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \\nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \\ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \\nchance to work.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \\nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \\nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \\nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \\nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \\nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \\nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \\ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \\nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \\nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \\nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \\ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \\nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \\nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \\nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \\nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \\nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \\nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \\nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \\nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \\nsomething there for them to do?\\n\\n\\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \\nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \\nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \\nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \\nsector.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \\nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \\nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \\nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \\nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \\ncreated before.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \\nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \\nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \\nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \\na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \\npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \\nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \\njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \\nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \\ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \\neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \\nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \\npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \\nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \\nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \\ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \\nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \\nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \\nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\\n\\t     \\n\\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \\ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \\nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \\n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \\nthe environment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \\nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \\nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \\nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \\njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \\nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \\npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \\nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \\nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \\nhas never fully emphasized before.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \\nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \\ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \\ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \\nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \\nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \\nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \\nyear.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \\nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \\nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \\ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \\nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \\nenvironment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \\nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \\nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \\nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \\nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \\nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \\nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \\nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \\nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \\nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \\nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \\nthey earn, but letting them earn.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \\nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \\ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \\nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \\nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \\nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \\nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \\nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \\nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \\nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \\nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \\nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \\nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \\nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \\nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \\nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \\nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \\nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \\nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \\nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \\nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \\nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \\nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \\nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \\nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \\nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \\nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \\ninvestments as well. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \\nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \\nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \\nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \\nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \\nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \\nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \\nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \\nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \\nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \\nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \\nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \\ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \\nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \\nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \\never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \\nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     That does not mean young people should not be \\nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \\nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \\nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \\nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \\npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \\ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \\nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \\njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \\npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \\njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \\nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \\nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \\nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \\nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \\nyoung people want.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \\nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \\npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \\nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \\nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \\nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \\noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \\nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \\neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \\nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \\nkidding.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \\ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \\ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \\nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \\ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \\nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \\nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \\ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \\ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \\nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \\neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \\nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \\nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \\nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \\nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \\neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \\nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \\nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \\nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \\nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \\nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \\nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \\npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \\nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \\nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \\nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \\nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \\nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \\nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \\nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\",\n",

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus and\\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.\\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\\nwill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.\\n===================================================\\nSENATORS SOLD\\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \\nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \\nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \\n\\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\\n==================================================\\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \\n\\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\\n\\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\\nin the New Brunswick city.\\n\\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\\n1400 for this year.\\n============================================================\\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n=========================================================\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies.

The first few weeks saw two games of\\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\\nhas been only one.

PST\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \\non the aid package.\\n\\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \\nPresident -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \\nyesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \\nand political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \\n\\n\\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \\nbasic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \\nFirst, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \\nwith available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \\nhave been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \\nno need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \\nany of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \\nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \\ntomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \\nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \\nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \\nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \\ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \\nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \\nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \\nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \\nfront of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \\ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \\ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \\nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \\ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \\nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \\ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \\ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \\nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \\nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \\nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \\na vastly expanded relationship.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \\nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \\ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \\nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \\nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \\nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \\ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \\nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \\nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \\nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \\nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \\npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \\nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \\nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \\nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \\nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \\nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \\nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \\nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \\nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \\nthereafter for the life of the deal.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \\nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \\ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \\nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \\nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \\nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \\ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \\nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President has also decided to create a \\nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \\ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \\nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \\nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \\nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \\nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \\npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \\nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \\npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \\nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \\ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \\nlaunching.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President is also calling for the development of \\na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \\ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \\nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \\nRussia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \\nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \\nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \\nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \\nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \\nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \\nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \\nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \\nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \\nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \\nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \\nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \\nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \\ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \\npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \\ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \\nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \\nenvironmental damage.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \\nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \\nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \\nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \\ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \\nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \\ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \\ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \\nproblem full-time.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \\ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \\nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \\njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \\ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \\nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \\nimportant.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \\nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \\nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \\nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \\nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \\nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \\nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \\ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \\ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \\n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \\nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \\nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \\nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \\nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \\nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \\nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \\nconference, the G-7 conference.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \\ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \\nobjectives with you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \\nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \\nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \\nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \\nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \\nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \\nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \\nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \\nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \\nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \\nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \\nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \\nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \\ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \\nconstruction of that storage facility.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \\nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \\nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \\nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \\nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \\nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \\nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \\nlast couple of years.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \\nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \\nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \\ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \\nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \\nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \\nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \\nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \\nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \\nas a very important step in that process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \\nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \\nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \\nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \\ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \\nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \\noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \\ntoday.  So it's completely new.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \\nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \\ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \\nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \\noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \\nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \\nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \\nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \\nRussia needs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \\nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \\nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \\nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \\nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \\nthat are already there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On that point, should other American companies \\nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \\nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \\nbillion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \\nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \\nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \\nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \\nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \\nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \\ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \\ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \\nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \\ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \\ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \\ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \\nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \\neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \\n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \\ncurrent year budget costs --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \\nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \\ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \\nwhich the payments are due?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \\nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \\nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \\nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \\nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \\ngoing to be involved in that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \\nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \\ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \\norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \\none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \\ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \\nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \\nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \\nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \\nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \\nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \\nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \\nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \\nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \\nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \\nour own government, but the resources of the American private \\nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \\nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \\nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \\nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \\nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \\nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \\nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \\nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \\nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \\nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \\nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \\nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \\nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \\nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \\nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \\ninto that situation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \\nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \\nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \\nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \\nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \\nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \\nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \\nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \\ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \\nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \\nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \\ncould promote American grain sales.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \\nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \\nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \\nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \\nfor a concessional loan program.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \\nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \\na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \\nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \\nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \\nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \\nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \\ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \\nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \\nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \\nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \\nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \\nand it's important for the American farm community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \\nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \\nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \\nis that right? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \\nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \\nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \\nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \\n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \\ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \\nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \\nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \\nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \\ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \\nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \\ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \\nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \\nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \\nthe short-term payments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \\nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \\nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \\nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \\nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \\nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \\nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \\ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \\nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \\nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \\nable to do so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \\nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \\nhave a range from 0 to --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \\nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \\nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \\nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \\nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \\nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \\nsame level of food imports from the West.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \\nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \\nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \\nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \\nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \\nsome of the other republics?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \\nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \\nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \\nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \\narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \\nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \\nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \\nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \\nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \\nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \\nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \\nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \\nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \\nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \\ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \\nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \\nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \\nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \\nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \\nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \\nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \\ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \\nsector can do that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \\ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \\ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \\ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \\ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \\nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \\non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \\nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \\nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \\nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \\nsignal to the American business community that we support their \\nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \\nsupport them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \\ndeliver on making Russia a more --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \\nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \\nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \\nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \\nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \\nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \\nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \\ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \\nthe work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \\nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \\nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \\nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \\nRussian government for distribution at their will?\\n\\t     \\t    \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \\nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \\nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \\nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \\nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \\nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \\nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \\naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \\nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \\nthese programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \\nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \\nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \\nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \\nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \\nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \\nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \\ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \\nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \\njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \\nnoticed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \\nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \\ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \\nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \\non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \\nPresident has to do on that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \\nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \\nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \\nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \\nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \\nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \\nyou got here?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \\nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \\nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \\nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \\nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \\nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \\nwe take any action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \\nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \\nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \\nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \\nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \\nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \\neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \\nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \\nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \\nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \\nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \\nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \\nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \\nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \\nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \\nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \\nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \\nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \\ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \\nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \\nit stands now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \\nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \\nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \\nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \\nthat it was not previously set to be?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \\nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \\nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \\nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \\nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \\nfunds might be expended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \\nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \\nfurther our programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \\nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \\nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \\nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \\nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \\nfound it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \\nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \\nFreedom Support Act funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In other words, all of the money is being \\ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \\nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \\nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \\nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \\ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \\nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \\n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \\nlegislative history of those funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     cooperation --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \\ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \\nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \\nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \\nhappened here --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \\nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \\nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \\nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \\nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \\nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \\ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \\nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \\ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \\nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \\nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \\ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \\nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \\nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q?\\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \\nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \\nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \\nearmarked and put it into this fund?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \\nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \\ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \\nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \\nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \\nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \\ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \\ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \\nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \\ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \\nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \\nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \\nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \\nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \\ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \\nAnd we'll do it.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \\npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \\nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \\nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \\non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     taken it way from any --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \\nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \\nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \\nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \\nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \\nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \\ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \\nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \\nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \\nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \\nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \\nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \\nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \\nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \\nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \\nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \\nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \\nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \\nbut we thought we should now.\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \\nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \\ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \\nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \\nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \\nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \\nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \\nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \\nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \\nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \\nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \\nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \\ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \\nis another Clinton initiative.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \\nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \\nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \\npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \\nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \\nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \\na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would also say that the President has given \\nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \\nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \\nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \\nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \\ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \\nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \\nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \\nobjective.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \\nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \\nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \\nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \\nassistance package for Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \\npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \\noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \\nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \\nRussian government?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \\nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \\ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \\nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \\nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \\nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \\nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \\nsource.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \\npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \\nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \\ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \\nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \\nexample of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \\na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \\narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \\nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \\nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \\nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \\ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \\na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \\nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \\nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \\nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \\nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \\nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \\nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \\nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \\non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \\nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \\nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \\nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \\nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \\nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \\ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \\nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \\nthem together and to focus their efforts.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \\nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \\nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \\nup in the next couple of days on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \\nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \\nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \\nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \\nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \\nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \\nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \\nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \\nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \\nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \\ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \\nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \\nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \\ntogether for about two weeks.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \\nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \\nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \\nIs that in the out years?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \\nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \\nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \\nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \\nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \\nthe state industries is important to them.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \\ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \\nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \\nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \\nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \\nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \\nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \\nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \\nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \\ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \\nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \\nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \\nallied governments that are also active.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \\nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \\nyou came in with?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \\npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \\nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \\nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \\nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \\nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \\nwhich is our base objective here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \\nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \\nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \\nprivatization?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \\nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \\nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \\ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \\nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     money for job training for workers whose \\njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \\nallocated any money for that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \\nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \\nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \\nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \\nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.

What we want to do is work over the next \\ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \\norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \\ndone.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \\nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \\nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \\nspend the money wisely.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is it about this program that convinces \\nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \\nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \\nespecially considering their other debt problem?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \\nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \\nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \\nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \\nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \\nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \\ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \\nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President say that the value of the \\nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \\nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \\nprogram that does this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \\ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \\nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \\ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \\nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \\nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \\nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \\nRussia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \\nthis program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \\nhave to make a long-term commitment to it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \\nrepay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \\nyears from now?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \\ngovernment has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \\nis that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \\ntheir oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \\nrevenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \\nfrom now to pay back those loans.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     substantial government-to-government loan \\nwe've ever gotten into with the Russians?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \\nanswer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \\non this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \\nthe previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \\njust ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     government loans in any other sector that \\nyou recall?

I never, ever thought that anyone\\nwould argue that Jagr\\'s higher +/- actually reflected better two-way\\nplay.\\n\\nIn my opinion, Francis\\'s low +/- is purely a result of him being asked\\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team\\'s top center\\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the\\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can\\'t even get\\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\\n\\n(By the way, don\\'t get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy\\nfloater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like\\novertime of playoff games).\\n',\n",

In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health\\ninsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like\\nsocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary\\ninsurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine\\'s Summer 1992 edition\\nhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,\\nincluding a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,\\nyou\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.\\nWith extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and\\nbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The\\npublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount\\nfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or\\naccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of\\nFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health\\ncosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other\\ntaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures\\nfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure\\nfor the U.S.\\n\\nThat the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund\\nis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back\\nin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health\\ninsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff\\nof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \"libertarian\"\\nfaction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that\\njust a few people have to be reminded that it\\'s not free (the average\\nCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American\\ncounterparts on issues like these).\\n\\nI\\'m one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about\\nleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian\\nnewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, \\'cos the 100%\\ninsurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn\\'t know\\nit, you\\'d believe it actually is socialized medicine (American\\nconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who\\nseriously call it that).  Canadians aren\\'t worried about the\\nAmericans, who spend 14%; we\\'re worried about the French and Germans\\nwho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that\\nshouldn\\'t be paid for out of general funds like physicals for\\ninsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that\\nthe Canadian health insurance hasn\\'t spiralled out of control despite\\nbeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to\\nspend all of your benefits\\' worth, and more if you can ... we\\'re a\\ndifferent culture.\\n\\n\\n\"Managed Care\" relies on HMO\\'s, which are unknown in most western\\nnations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France\\nand Germany (I\\'m Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says\\nof HMO/NHS approaches, \"We left that behind with East Germany!\").\\nSure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling\\ndoctors with budget strings.\\n\\nIn Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France\\nand Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public\\nhospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO\\'s.  The divisions\\nare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked\\n\"sickness funds\" over a century old while Canada divides by their\\nprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the\\ndoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)\\n\\nWith such an open-ended system, it\\'s no surprise that Canada is #2 to\\nthe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go.

              "  'To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:\\n\\n  From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people \\nin the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St. \\nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \\nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \\ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \\nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \\nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \\nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \\ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \\ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can\\'t remember his name) \\nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \\nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \\nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \\nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \\nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \\nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \\nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \\nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \\nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \\nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \\nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \\nwhich may happen.\\n\\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \\nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \"\\nIce Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn\\'t \\nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \\nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \\nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see \\nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\\tSo, Minnesota may end up \\ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tGo Sabres!',\n",

The\\nJet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's\\nlegs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.\\n\\tThe Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.\\nThis was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected\\nor were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight\\nWinnipeg defence that were never supported.\\n\\tHowever, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive\\nlapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff\\nin the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with\\nno Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the\\ngame up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a \\nbackhand even though he was off balance. \\n\\tBy then it was too late for the Jets to come back.

Unless\\n  they had strong evidence that the children were in IMMEDIATE danger\\n  then \"the best they could\" have done was to SHOW RESTRAINT.\\n\\n  Some of us DID predict this outcome, or at least suggested a\\n  strong possibility of it.  I, for one, said that in the event of\\n  an assault against the building the CHILDREN were the ones in danger\\n  either from the assault itself or from a \"Jonestown\" (my phrase\\n  a week after the seige started) style suicide.  And as I pointed\\n  out then, and repeatedly over the objections of people on the net \\n  who disagreed with me, an adult may freely choose suicide but they\\n  have no right to impose this choice on their children.\\n\\n  Now, while I don\\'t expect the FBI to pay any attention to what I \\n  have to say on this, I *DO* expect them to figure it out on their\\n  own or to take the advice of experts.  The cult specialist inter-\\n  viewed in yesterday\\'s Boston Globe said he was repeatedly \"stonewalled\"\\n  by the FBI when he pointed out to them that their confrontational\\n  tactics played perfectly into Koresh\\'s mad view of the world and so \\n  increased the chance of a tragic outcome.\\n\\n\\n  Give *US* a break!   Pumping teargas for 45 minutes into a compound \\n  filled with CHILDREN?!!   This doesn\\'t seem to show much regard for \\n  their lives or safety.   \"Nontoxic teargas\" is an oxymoron.  Children\\n  have tiny respiratory passages which are easily blocked by the secretions\\n  induced by teargas; moreover teargas can easily cause fatalities in anyone\\n  subject to laryngospasms, asthma, or heart disease.\\n\\n  If a madman is holding a gun to a hostage, someone who provokes the \\n  madman by attacking him bears nearly as much repsonsibility for the\\n  death of the hostage as the madman himself.  These kinds of situations\\n  have to be handled *delicately* - not by surrounding a place with\\n  tanks and heavily armed personnel and blaring rock music from loud-\\n  speakers at all hours.

Their confrontational approach reinforced\\n  every single message Koresh was giving his followers, virtually guarantee-\\n  ing that whatever crazy solution Koresh proposed would be followed\\n  willingly.

              "  'By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff\\n\\nAt 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.\\nTheir cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of\\n17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to\\nthe playoff-bound Blues.\\n\\nThe scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.\\nWith the North Stars\\' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the\\nfinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit\\nplaying.\\n\\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\\nTampa\\'s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\\nsupervisor John D\\'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\\n\\n``I\\'m glad I didn\\'t see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\\n\\nIf the goal had counted, he\\'d have been more upset than he was by the Blues\\'\\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\\nthe playoffs tempered Berry\\'s anger.\\n\\n``It wasn\\'t pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn\\'t have, but\\nit did.\"\\n\\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\\'s end.\\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\\nChicago Stadium.\\n\\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\\n\\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\\n\\n``It\\'s a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\\'d have kept working, it would have\\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\\n\\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\\n``We won, and that\\'s all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\\n\\nSome players didn\\'t have a problem.\\n\\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\\'t quit,\" said Rich\\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\\ncan\\'t allow five goals like we did, that\\'s not right.\\n\\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\\n\\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues\\' effort. Somehow,\\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota\\'s loss.\\n\\n``I didn\\'t know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\\nbench. I didn\\'t realize it was a final for some reason. We\\'re in the playoffs,\\nand that\\'s great, but it\\'s a little disappointing to play like we did at the\\nend.\"\\n\\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\\n\\n``I told them I didn\\'t want to see the score, I didn\\'t want to know the score,\"\\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\\'s the approach we took.\"\\n\\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\\n\\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\\n\\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\\n\\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\\n\\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \\nrebound of Bret Hedican\\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\\n\\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\\n\\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He\\'s in heaven now, and\\nI know he was watching. I know he\\'s happy.\"\\n\\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\\'s shutout just 18 seconds\\nlater, making it 5-1.\\n\\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\\n\\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\\nperiod.\\n\\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan\\'s second goal stand up as the\\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\"',\n",

I think\\nit was also shown during the Calgary-LA game. \\n\\n(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\\n\\nTopics\\n------\\n\\nDon\\'s Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo,\\nWendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.\\n\\nEpisode Summary\\n---------------\\n\\nOnce again, the episode started with a shot of Don\\'s tie... This\\nwas a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the\\ncharacters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the\\nCat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.\\n\\nRon Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs\\ngame. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players \"They\\nwon in their building, we\\'re going to win in ours\".\\n\\nDon then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour\\nhas never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he\\ngot 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that\\nhe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible\\nfor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour\\nfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk\\nresulting in a goal.\\n\\nOn the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in\\nthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed\\nhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells\\nthe Leaf players \"Don\\'t let them score on you\".\\n\\nRon brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal\\nwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner\\ndisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don\\nthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of\\ninstant replay.\\n\\nOn the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning\\nthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.\\nFuhr should be getting 1/2 the team\\'s playoff checks for his\\nplay.\\n\\nWendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance\\nduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying\\nthat he can\\'t play the way he should, because of the league\\'s\\nnew rules. \"This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its\\nall hack and slash.\" Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the\\nproblems.\\n\\nDon\\'s opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings\\nGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray\\nwas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination\\nof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article\\nin which Murray makes the following statements: \"Players don\\'t fight\\nbecause they\\'re afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.\\nInstead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing\\neach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there\\nwouldn\\'t be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.\"\\n\\nDon warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to \"smarten up\" with\\nfighting in hockey.

Chris basically raised the possibility that the AHL \\nhierarchy is biased in favor of the Indians. He noted that the offices\\nfor the league are in Spring. and many ex-Indians are working for the AHL.\\nFurthermore, he also informed me that back a few years ago in the Cup \\nfinals between Roch and Spring, that the Amerks charged favoritism by the office\\nand that:\\n\\n\"...there were little questionable things liket he AHL president and\\nstaff attending all games with the Springfield brass, including sitting\\nin their box for the game in Springfield and, according to the Rochester\\nmedia, openly cheering for Springfield.\"\\n\\nCertainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this\\nis true. I don\\'t know if this is anything more than whining on the\\npart of the Amerks (they have pulled this sort of crap against the\\nWings before) but if true, this is somthing that seriously raises\\nquestions about President Jack Butterfield\\'s leadership.\\n\\nBTW- This was posted with the permission of Chris',\n",

Should either of the two new \\nteams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in \\n1994.\\n\\n        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the \\n1995 draft in Winnipeg.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\\n \\n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50\\'s was made up of people who lived in \\nand around Montreal.

Short-\\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\\n \\n Q: What is the five-hole?\\n A: The space between a goalie\\'s pads. There are five major scoring zones: \\n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \\nright, and (5) five-hole.\\n \\n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950\\'s when two best-of-seven \\nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \\ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\\n\\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \\nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \\nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \\nBlues.

She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \\nlost the game, 6-4.\\n\\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \\nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \\nworth about $42 million.

Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and\\nthf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.\\nI guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult\\nfor them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my\\nsysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his\\ndefense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has\\nbeen posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed\\nat me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding\\nvia netmail...)\\n\\nWhile I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin\\nto get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post\\nI made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not\\nwhat the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I\\nAM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him\\naxed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. \"Argumentum\\nad silence-your-opponent-um\"?! I would have thought he would have\\nwanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and\\nseem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).\\n\\nThe issue that seems to be: \"Is the following an advertisement?\"\\nApparently, Ted and Mark think so...\\n\\n1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken \\n\\t*off the net* from last year. If reposting an article\\n\\tconstitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post\\n\\tdid have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one\\n\\thad posted the address and subscription price of \"Newsweek\",\\n\\twould that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.\\n2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of\\n\\t\"proof\" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains\\n\\tto my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and\\n\\tbehold, \"poof\", there goes my account. This one had an\\n\\taddress in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!\\n\\nIf you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE\\nITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send\\na note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get\\n\"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful...\" or whatever; they\\nonly get \"I don\\'t like what that user is doing because...\".\\nPlease do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them\\nin a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.\\n\\nIn my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying \"Thanks for\\nthe info\" or \"Could you send me such and such?\" or \"Your posts are\\nvery interesting... keep it up.\" and only a handfull of \"Go aways\". But,\\nI guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to\\nconvince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant\\na message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...\"My name is Ted and\\nand this is Mark... We\\'re from the thought police. Seems you have\\nsome pretty dangerous ideas here, and we\\'re here to confiscate them...\")\\nNWO Indeed!\\n\\nGuess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with\\na new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.\\nI will be on for a few more days and then... that\\'s all folks!\\nYour comments and support are requested. I can no longer post\\nto news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit\\nfrom making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. \\nSeems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side\\nshut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the\\nprocess of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that\\na lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.\\nOh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I\\nwas just getting started.\\n\\nIt should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40\\ntimes of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the\\ncontrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank\\'s motivations for getting me axed?\\nWe all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people\\non the net that are of \"interest\" to the government, and Ted sure seems\\nto have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does\\nhe work for? The University of Chicago which he \"attends\"(?) is well\\nknown as one of the biggest NWO supporters...\\n\\nAnd finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here\\nin the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the\\nprocess of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe\\na TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Since I\\nam longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERY\\nsoon, I hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via:\\n\\n\\tA. J.

Many classifiers achieve very\\n  high F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\n  aren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\n  For example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\n  which is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n    >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n    >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n    >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n    ...                                      categories=categories)\\n    >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n    >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n    >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n    MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n    >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n    >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n    0.88213...\\n\\n  (The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\n  the training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\n  multinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\n  yet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\n  Let\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n    >>> import numpy as np\\n    >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n    ...     feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\\n    ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n    ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n    ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n    ...\\n    >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n    alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n    comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n    sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n    talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\n  You can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n  - Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n    ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n  - Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n    a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n  - The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n    previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n    wrote:\"\\n  - Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n    were posting at the time.\\n\\n  With such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\n  barely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\n  same high level.\\n\\n  For this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\n  parameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\n  of each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n  ``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\n  blocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n    >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n    ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n    ...                                      categories=categories)\\n    >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n    >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n    >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n    0.77310...\\n\\n  This classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\n  metadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\n  It loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n    >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n    ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n    ...                                       categories=categories)\\n    >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n    >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n    >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n    MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n    >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n    >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n    >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n    0.76995...\\n\\n  Some other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try the\\n  :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n  example with and without the `remove` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. rubric:: Data Considerations\\n\\nThe Cleveland Indians is a major league baseball team based in Cleveland,\\nOhio, USA. In December 2020, it was reported that \"After several months of\\ndiscussion sparked by the death of George Floyd and a national reckoning over\\nrace and colonialism, the Cleveland Indians have decided to change their\\nname.\" Team owner Paul Dolan \"did make it clear that the team will not make\\nits informal nickname -- the Tribe -- its new team name.\" \"It\\'s not going to\\nbe a half-step away from the Indians,\" Dolan said.\"We will not have a Native\\nAmerican-themed name.\"\\n\\nhttps://www.mlb.com/news/cleveland-indians-team-name-change\\n\\n.. rubric:: Recommendation\\n\\n- When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this\\n  by setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n- This text dataset contains data which may be inappropriate for certain NLP\\n  applications.

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your\\n   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.\\n\\n2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the\\n   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you\\n   are thrown out of the game, and fined.\\n\\n3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot\\n   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.\\n\\nBesides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties\\nin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,\\nuntil the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in\\nthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.\\n\\nThis works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most\\nexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.\\nNext, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can\\ntake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network\\nannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and\\nMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before\\nthe PA announcer says it.\\n\\nOh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play\\ncannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network\\ncan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told\\nthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a \\nchance of pronouncing his name right.\\n\\nSeriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,\\nfor the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is\\nso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting\\ncontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their \\nroutines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods\\neither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The\\ngame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a\\n10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.\\n\\nThe reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in\\ncommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.\\nOn TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch\\nit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then\\nit truly is a sad day.\\n\\nEnough for now.\"],\n",
